</div>
<p><strong>Voltage</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the last section we calculated the work done <span><strong>by</strong></span> the electrostatic force when a particle of charge <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is moved directly away from a fixed particle of charge <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(r_i\)</span> is the initial distance and <span class="math inline">\(r_f\)</span> the final distance from the charge <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, then the work was found by integrating <span class="math inline">\(kQq/r^2\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(r_i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(r_f\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W_{electrostatic}(r_i \rightarrow r_f) = k{{Qq} \over r_i} -
                        k{{Qq} \over r_f}\]</span></p>
<p>This result was for the special path that was a straight line away from the charge <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. We will show in class that one gets the <span><strong>same result for any path</strong></span> that the charge <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> travels between <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}_f\)</span>. this is because the electrostatic force is a central force, and hence conservative. The only contribution to the work done by the electric force is from the component of the path element that is radially away from the source charge <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. Only the initial and final distance matter in the net work done by the electrostatic force on the point charge <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is a very nice result, and can be generalized to any number of "point" source particles. Suppose we have <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> small "point" particles. Label them 1, 2, ...., i, ... N, and let them remain fixed in place. Label the charge on the iâ€™th particle as <span class="math inline">\(Q_i\)</span>. Since the superposition principle applies to the electric force, the work done <span><strong>by</strong></span> the electric force as the point charge <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> follows a path from <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}_a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}_b\)</span> is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W_{electrostatic}(r_a \rightarrow r_b) = \sum_{i=1}^N k{{Q_iq} \over r_{ia}} -
                        k{{Q_iq} \over r_{ib}}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(r_{ia}\)</span> is the initial distance from the particle to <span class="math inline">\(Q_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r_{ib}\)</span> is the final distance from the particle to <span class="math inline">\(Q_i\)</span>. Notice in this equation the <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> can be factored out!</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W_{electrostatic}(r_a \rightarrow r_b) = q \sum_{i=1}^N ( k{{Q_i} \over r_{ia}} -
                        k{{Q_i} \over r_{ib}})\]</span></p>
<p>This is possible since the electric force is proportional to the charge on an object. From this equation we see that it is useful to consider the work done by the electrostatic force <span><strong>per charge</strong></span>. We call this quantity the <span><strong>electric potential difference</strong></span> between the points <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}_a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}_b\)</span>. It is also refered to as the <span><strong>voltage difference</strong></span>, <span class="math inline">\(V(\vec{r}_a) - V(\vec{r}_b)\)</span>, between the two points.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W_{electrostatic}(r_a \rightarrow r_b) = q(V(\vec{r}_a) - V(\vec{r}_b))\]</span></p>
<p>Comparing with the equation above, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V(\vec{r}_a) = \sum_{i=1}^N k{Q_i \over r_{ia}}\]</span></p>
<p>where the formula for <span class="math inline">\(V(\vec{r}_b)\)</span> is the same with <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> replaced by <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(V(\vec{r}_a)\)</span> is called the electric potential at the position <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}_a\)</span>. Usually the subscript <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is omitted, and the expression for the electric voltage at the position <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V(\vec{r}) = \sum_{i=1}^N k{Q_i \over r_{i}}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(r_i\)</span> is the distance between the position <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> and the point charge <span class="math inline">\(Q_i\)</span>. If there is only one source charge, then <span class="math inline">\(V(\vec{r}) = k Q/r\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the distance from the position <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> to the charge <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. If there is a continuous distribution of charge, then the sum becomes an integral:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V(\vec{r}) = \int k {{\rho (\vec{r}&#39;) dV&#39;} \over {|\vec{r} - \vec{r}&#39;|}}\]</span></p>
<p>In class we will do examples for which we calculate the voltage and voltage difference for various point and continuous charge distributions.<br />
<br />
. An important application of voltage difference is that it is directly related to the work done by the electric force on the charge <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\Delta V \equiv V(\vec{r}_a) - V(\vec{r}_b)\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(q \Delta V\)</span> is the work done on the charge <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> if it travels from point <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to point <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. The energy the particle acquires is simply <span class="math inline">\(q \Delta V\)</span>. Often this energy gain is equal to the particles gain in K.E.<br />
. <span class="math inline">\(V(\vec{r})\)</span> is defined at a point in space, the point at the position <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span>. Nothing needs to be at the point. This concept is similiar to the electric field. The electric field is the force per charge; <span><strong>The voltage is the potential energy per charge</strong></span>.<br />
. Although <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> is a vector, a position vector, the voltage is a <span><strong>scalar</strong></span>. Since voltage is a scalar, it is much easier to calculate than the electric field. There is no direction involved in using the superposition principle.<br />
. Only voltage differences are measurable. Our expression for the voltage due to a point particle of magnitude <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(k Q/r\)</span>, takes as a reference <span class="math inline">\(V(\infty) = 0\)</span>.<br />
</p>
<p>One can always calculate the voltage at a point in space by summing up the expression above over all the "point" particles in the system. However, it is often easier to express the voltage difference in terms of the electric field. This can be done as follows. First start with the expression for the work done by the electrostatic force for a path going from <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}_a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}_b\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W_{electrostatic}(\vec{r}_a \rightarrow \vec{r}_b) = \int_{\vec{r}_a}^{\vec{r}_b} 
                                                   \vec{F} \cdot d \vec{r}\]</span></p>
<p>where the integral is over the path from <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}_a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}_b\)</span>. Since the electrostatic force is conservative, one obtains the same result for any path between the two points. Since <span class="math inline">\(\vec{F} = q \vec{E}\)</span>, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W_{electrostatic}(\vec{r}_a \rightarrow \vec{r}_b) = q \int \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{r}\]</span></p>
<p>However, the left side of the equation is just the difference in voltage <span class="math inline">\(\Delta V\)</span> times <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. Thus, the <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>â€™s cancel and we are left with</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta V  = \int_{\vec{r}_a}^{\vec{r}_b} \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{r}\]</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V(\vec{r}_a) - V(\vec{r}_b)  = \int_{\vec{r}_a}^{\vec{r}_b} \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{r}\]</span></p>
<p>This equation is also written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V(\vec{r}_b) - V(\vec{r}_a)  = - \int_{\vec{r}_a}^{\vec{r}_b} \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{r}\]</span></p>
<p>We will do a number of examples in which we calculate the difference in electric potential by integrating <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E} \cdot d \vec{r}\)</span> over a path. The right side of the equation is called a line (or path) integral.</p>
<p>If the electric field is known at every point in space, one can use the above equation to calculate the voltage difference between any two points. Thus, from knowledge of the electric field, the electric potential can be determined. What about the converse? If the voltage is known at every point in space, can one determine the electric field? The answer is yes. Since <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is obtained by integrating <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span>, then you might guess that <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> is related to the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. However, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> is a vector, and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is a scalar. We will probably need three derivatives of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, one for each component, to find all three components of <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span>. Consider first <span class="math inline">\(E_x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s choose a path for the above equation to be on the x-axis. If we choose <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> to be at <span class="math inline">\(x + \Delta x\)</span> and choose <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to be at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, then the above equation for the voltage difference between these two positions is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V(x+\Delta x) - V(x) = - E_x \Delta x\]</span></p>
<p>Dividing by <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span> and taking the limit as <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x \rightarrow 0\)</span> we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_x = lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} - {{V(x+\Delta x) - V(x)} \over {\Delta x}}\]</span></p>
<p>which yields</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_x = - {{\partial V} \over {\partial x}}\]</span></p>
<p>The partial derivative is used, since <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> depends on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. When one takes the partial derivative with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> are held constant. The same procedure can be done with the y- and z- directions:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  E_x &amp; = &amp; - {{\partial V(x,y,z)} \over {\partial x}}\\
  E_y &amp; = &amp; - {{\partial V(x,y,z)} \over {\partial y}}\\
  E_z &amp; = &amp; - {{\partial V(x,y,z)} \over {\partial z}}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>In summary, we have discussed two ways to find the electric potential at a point, or electrical potential difference between two points:<br />
) use the formula for a point charge source <span class="math inline">\(kQ/r\)</span> and sum up (or integrate) over the source charges<br />
) First determine <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> and carry out the line integral <span class="math inline">\(\int \vec{E}
\cdot d\vec{r}\)</span>. We will do examples in class, and I present an example of each method here in the notes.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Suppose we have a uniformly charged ring of radius <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and total charge <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. Lets find the electric potential <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> on the axis of the ring a distance <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> from the center. For this problem, it is best to "chop" up the ring into small pieces, and sum up the contribution from each piece. Let the pieces be labeled as 1, 2, 3, ... , i, ...., and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q_i\)</span> be the charge on the iâ€™th piece. The potential at the position <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> due to the iâ€™th piece, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta V_i\)</span>, is just <span class="math inline">\(k \Delta Q_i/\sqrt{x^2 + R^2}\)</span>. This is true since each small piece can be treated as a point particle and the distance from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to the piece is just <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{x^2 + R^2}\)</span> via Pythagorus Theorum.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta V_i = k {{\Delta Q_i} \over {\sqrt{x^2+R^2}}}\]</span></p>
<p>Note: <span><strong>there is no direction to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta V_i\)</span></strong></span>, potential is a scalar. When we add up the contributions of the pieces over the whole ring, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> do not change, thus</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V = {k \over {\sqrt{x^2+R^2}}} \sum \Delta Q_i\]</span></p>
<p>The sum over the <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q_i\)</span> just adds up to <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V(x,0,0) = k {Q \over {\sqrt{x^2+R^2}}}\]</span></p>
<p>We can differentiate the above expression to find the electric field on the axis:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  E_x &amp; = &amp; - {{\partial V} \over {\partial x}}\\
      &amp; = &amp; {{kQx} \over {(x^2 + R^2)^{3/2}}}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Note: this is the same result we obtained by using Coulombâ€™s Law for the electric field and integrating over the ring. Find the electric potential first and differentiating was easier, and often is. Sometimes it is easier to find <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> first and then <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, and sometimes it is easier to determine <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> first and differentiate to obtain <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span>.<br />
<br />
Suppose we have two flat identical plates, each with an area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Suppose the plates are parallel to each other and separated by a distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. Lets also assume that <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{A} &gt;&gt; d\)</span>, that is the plates are very large compared to the distance separating them. Lets place a total of <span class="math inline">\(+Q\)</span> amount of charge on one plate and a total of <span class="math inline">\(-Q\)</span> on the other. We spread the charge uniformly over the surface area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. What is the electric potential difference (voltage difference) from one plate to the other?</p>
<p>In this case it is easiest to first determine the electric field between the plates and carry out <span class="math inline">\(\int \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{r}\)</span>. We already determined the electric field from an infinite plate using Gaussâ€™ Law as well as using Coulombâ€™s Law and integrating over the plate. Since <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{A} &gt;&gt;&gt; d\)</span>, we can approximate the plates as infinite. Previously we found the electric field between the parallel plates by adding up the electric field from each plate: <span class="math inline">\(|\vec{E}| = Q/(2 A \epsilon_0) + Q/(2 A \epsilon_0)\)</span>. So the net electric field between the plates is <span class="math inline">\(|\vec{E}| = Q/(A \epsilon_0)\)</span> and is <span><strong>constant</strong></span> between the plates. Since the electric force is conservative, we can take calculate the potential difference using any path from one plate to the other. Lets choose a path straight across, and since <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> is constant, the line integral is very easy.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  V &amp; = &amp; \int \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{r} \\
    &amp; = &amp; E d\\
  V &amp; = &amp; {{Qd} \over {A \epsilon_0}}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The line integral is simple for the following reasons: 1) since <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d \vec{r}\)</span> are in the same direction, the dot product is just the produce of the magnitude of <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d \vec{r}\)</span>. 2) Since <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> is constant, the line integral is just <span class="math inline">\(|\vec{E}|\)</span> times the distance between the plates.</p>
<p>Remember that the voltage difference gives us the electrical potential energy change <span><strong>per charge</strong></span> of a particle. That is, if a particle of charge <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> travels through a potential difference <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, the work done by the electrical force is <span class="math inline">\(W = q V\)</span>. <span><strong>If the electrical force is the only force that does work on the particle</strong></span>, then the gain in K.E. is <span class="math inline">\(q V\)</span> so</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[qV = {{mv_f^2} \over 2} - {{mv_i^2} \over 2}\]</span></p>
<p>If the particle starts from rest, it attains a speed <span class="math inline">\(v = \sqrt{2 q V/m}\)</span>. If an electron travels through a voltage difference of one volt, the work done on it by the electrical force is <span class="math inline">\(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\)</span>C <span class="math inline">\((1)\)</span>Volt = <span class="math inline">\(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\)</span> Joules. This unit of energy is called an electron-volt or eV. <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>eV = <span class="math inline">\(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\)</span> Joules.</p>
<p><strong>Capacitance</strong></p>
<p>Capacitance is a property of <span><strong>two conductors</strong></span>. Suppose we have two conductors (metals) that are initially uncharged. Suppose we then put a total charge of <span class="math inline">\(+Q\)</span> on one and a total charge of <span class="math inline">\(-Q\)</span> on the other. This can be accomplished by transfering electrons from one to the other. If we wait for the charges (electrons) to come to static equilibrium, the electric fields within each conductor will be zero. This means that the whole conductor is at the same electrical potential. At points outside the conductors there will be electric fields, and <span class="math inline">\(\int \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{r}\)</span> from one conductor to the other will be the potential difference <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> between the conductors.</p>
<p>Now, there is a nice property about the potential difference. If we were to transfer twice as much charge, the electric fields everywhere would double and so would the potential difference <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. If three times as much charge is transfered, the electric fields would triple and so would <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. That is, <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(V = \int \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{r}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> from Coulombâ€™s law. Thus the voltage between two conductors with equal and opposite charge is proportional to the magnitude of the charge on them:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V \propto Q\]</span></p>
<p>This can also be written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q \propto V\]</span></p>
<p>Replacing the proportional sign with an equal sign and a constant we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q = C V\]</span></p>
<p>where the constant <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is called the capacitance of the two conductors. A unit of capacitance is Coulomb/Volt. The capacitance depends only on the geometry of the two conductors.</p>
<p>Lets calculate the capacitance of two parallel plate conductors. Let each plate have an area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and let the plates be separated by a distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.<br />
Recipe for calculating capacitance:<br />
a) first place a charge of <span class="math inline">\(+Q\)</span> on one plate and a charge of <span class="math inline">\(-Q\)</span> on the other<br />
b) determine <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> for points between the conductors<br />
c) calculate <span class="math inline">\(V = \int \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{r}\)</span><br />
d) divide <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> to find <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.<br />
<br />
For the parallel plate conductors, we already did this and found <span class="math inline">\(V = Qd/(A \epsilon_0)\)</span>. Thus, the capacitance for the parallel plates is <span class="math inline">\(C = A \epsilon_0 / d\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> only depends on the geometry of the conductors and not on any charge or voltage they might have. <span><strong>If</strong></span> the conductors have a potential difference of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, <span><strong>then</strong></span> they each acquire a charge of <span class="math inline">\(CV\)</span>.<br />

Consider two cylindrical shells that are coaxial. Each shell is a conductor. Let them both have a length <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>, and let one have a radius <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and the other a radius <span class="math inline">\(b &gt; a\)</span>. Lets also assume that <span class="math inline">\(l &gt;&gt; (b-a)\)</span>, so we can treat the capacitor as being infinitely long. Now, letâ€™s find the capacitance of these two conductors.</p>
<p>First, suppose there is a total charge of <span class="math inline">\(+Q\)</span> on the inner most conductor, and a charge of <span class="math inline">\(-Q\)</span> on the outer one. Next, we need to find the electric field in the space between the conductors. Since <span class="math inline">\(l &gt;&gt; (b-a)\)</span> we can make the approxmation that the conductors are infinitely long. In that case the electric field between the conductors must point away from the axis of the conductors. We used Gaussâ€™ Law previously for the case of an infinitely long rod, and the same analysis will apply here. We can choose as a mathematical surface a "can" that is co-axial with the cylinders of length <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and radius <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(a&lt;r&lt;b\)</span>. The flux through the ends is zero. Applying Gaussâ€™ Law for the "can" surface gives:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2 \pi r d \; E = {{Q (d/l)} \over \epsilon_0}\]</span></p>
<p>Canceling the length of the can <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, we obtain the magnitude of the electric field between the conductors to be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E = {{Q} \over {2 \pi \epsilon_0 l r}}\]</span></p>
<p>where the direction is radial. Next we need to calculate the voltage difference between the conductors: <span class="math inline">\(\Delta V = \int \vec{E} \cdot
d \vec{r}\)</span>. If we take as a path for the integral a path radially away from the axis then <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d \vec{r}\)</span> are parallel, the line integral becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\int \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{r} = \int_a^b {{Q} \over {2 \pi \epsilon_0 l r}} dr\]</span></p>
<p>Carrying out the integral gives:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V = {Q \over {2 \pi \epsilon_0 l}} ln(b/a)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the potential difference between the conductors. Notice that <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> are proportional to each other. If <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is doubled, so must the charge on the conductors also double. The capacitance is the ratio of <span class="math inline">\(Q/V\)</span>, which gives:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C = {{2 \pi \epsilon_0 l} \over {ln(b/a)}}\]</span></p>
<p><br />
. In both cases the capacitance of the pair of conductors only depends on the geometry of the conductors. Not on how much charge or voltage they might have.<br />
. In both cases the capacitance equals a distance times <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0\)</span>. In metric units <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12}\)</span> C<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>/(N m<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>). These units are equal to <span class="math inline">\(F/m\)</span> (Farads per meter). Since <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0\)</span> is so small, it is difficult to build a capacitor with a large value for <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> in Farads using small materials. One needs to use a dialectric material between the conductors.<br />

<p><strong>Capacitors in Circuits</strong></p>
<p>Capacitors are important in electrical applications, and we now want to consider how they behave in simple circuits. We will first consider their properties when they are placed in parallel and in series.</p>
<p>Circuit elements are connected to each other by wires which are themselves conductors. There is very little energy loss through the conducting wires, so a good rule for <span><strong>steady state circuits</strong></span> is the following: <span><em>Any two points in a circuit that are connected by wires only are at the same electrical potential</em></span>. By steady state circuit we mean one in which the currents are not changing in time and there are no changing magnetic fields through the circuit. In the next section we will consider the effects of changing magnetic fields. However, we will first start with circuits for which these effects are small and can be ignored.<br />
<br />
Consider two capacitors whose right sides are connected together by a wire and whose left sides are connected together by another wire. Call one "1" and the other "2". Let the capacitance of "1" be <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span>, and the capacitance of "2" be <span class="math inline">\(C_2\)</span>. Since the left sides are connected together by a conducting wire they are at the same electrical potential. Since the right sides are connected together by a wire they are also at the same electrical potential. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(V_1 = V_2 \equiv V\)</span>. If the electrical voltage across each of the capacitors is <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, then there will be a charge of <span class="math inline">\(Q_1 = C_1 V\)</span> on the plates of capacitor "1". There will be a charge of <span class="math inline">\(Q_2 = C_2 V\)</span> on the plates of capacitor "2". The net charge on both plates is just the sum <span class="math inline">\(Q_{net} = Q_1 + Q_2\)</span> which is <span class="math inline">\(Q_{net} = V (C_1 + C_2)\)</span>. Since the capacitance is <span class="math inline">\(Q_{net}/V\)</span>, we see that the effective (or equivalant) capacitance of two capacitors in parallel is <span class="math inline">\(C_1 + C_2\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C_{equiv} = C_1 + C_2\]</span></p>
<p>for capacitors in parallel.<br />
<br />
Consider two parallel plate capacitors called "1" and "2". Let the right side of "1" be connected to the left side of "2". The left side of "1" and the right side of "2" are open. Suppose the capacitors are initially uncharged. Now transfer an amount of charge <span class="math inline">\(+Q\)</span> from the right side of "2" to the left side of "1". The left side of "1" will have a charge of <span class="math inline">\(+Q\)</span> and the right side of "2" will have a charge of <span class="math inline">\(-Q\)</span>. What about the other sides of the capacitors?</p>
<p>Since the left side of "2" is a conductor, the electric field inside must be zero. For this to happen, a charge of <span class="math inline">\(+Q\)</span> must come to the left side of "2". This will leave a charge of <span class="math inline">\(-Q\)</span> on the right side of "1". Thus, when equilibrium is reached, there will be a charge of <span class="math inline">\(+Q\)</span> on the left and a charge of <span class="math inline">\(-Q\)</span> on the right sides <span><em>of each capacitor</em></span>. If two capacitors in series are initially uncharged, when charged <span><strong>the same amount of charge will be on the plates of each capacitor</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(V_1\)</span> be the voltage difference between the plates of "1" and <span class="math inline">\(V_2\)</span> the voltage difference between the plates of "2". If we evaluate <span class="math inline">\(\int \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{r}\)</span> from the left side of "1" to the right side of "2" we will obtain <span class="math inline">\(V_1 + V_2\)</span>. That is, the potential difference across both capacitors, <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, will equal the sum of the potential differences across each capacitor.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V = V_1 + V_2\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(V_1\)</span> is the potential difference across "1" and <span class="math inline">\(V_2\)</span> the potential difference across "2". However, <span class="math inline">\(V_i = Q/C_i\)</span>, so</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V = {Q \over C_1} + {Q \over C_2}\]</span></p>
<p>The equivalent (or effective) capacitance of the two capacitors in series is <span class="math inline">\(C_{equiv} = Q/V\)</span> or</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C_{equiv} = {1 \over {(1/C_1) + (1/C_2)}}\]</span></p>
<p>This equation is usually written as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{1 \over C_{equiv}} = {1 \over C_1} + {1 \over C_2}\]</span></p>
<p>The main ideas in deriving these equations for combining capacitors is that 1) for capacitors in parallel the voltage is the same across both capacitors; and 2) for capacitors in series the charge on each capacitor is the same (assuming they started out uncharged).</p>
<p><strong>Current</strong></p>
<p>Consider a parallel plate capacitor with capacitance <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Suppose we put a charge <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> on one plate and a charge <span class="math inline">\(-Q\)</span> on the other plate. The charges will stay on the plates for a long time (ideally forever). If we now connect a wire (conductor) from one plate to the other, what will happen? Now we have one big conductor, and charge will flow until both sides are neutral. Actually electrons will flow from the negative side to the positive. We will do a demonstration in lecture that will demonstrate the charge (electrons) flowing. The flow of charge is called <span><strong>electric current</strong></span>.</p>
<p>In many applications the electrons flow through wires. If the charge (or electrons) flow in a "thin" wire, we can count the number of coulombs that pass a point in the wire per unit time, and can describe the current in terms of Coulombs/sec. A Coulomb/sec is defined as an <span><strong>Ampere</strong></span> or simply an Amp. The current in a wire is often given the symbol <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the charge is not flowing in a wire, then one needs a more general expression. The expression needs to specify the direction of the charge flow as well as the amount of charge flowing. Borrowing the concept from fluid flow, a useful definition would be the charge density, <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> times the velocity vector. A good name for this quantity is <span><strong>current density</strong></span> and is given the symbol <span class="math inline">\(\vec{J}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{J} \equiv \rho \vec{v}_d\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is the charge density and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{v}_d\)</span> is the <span><strong>drift velocity vector</strong></span> of the charge. Note that the current density is defined <span><strong>at a point</strong></span>. A wire is not needed. However, if the current is flowing in a wire, then <span class="math inline">\(\vec{J}\)</span> will point in the direction of the wire. The current <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> in a wire is related to <span class="math inline">\(|\vec{J}|\)</span> in the wire. The amount of charge <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q\)</span> that flows past a point in a time <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> is just <span class="math inline">\(\rho v_d \Delta t \; A\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(v_d\)</span> is the drift speed of the charge and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the area of the wire:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta Q = \rho v_d A \Delta t\]</span></p>
<p>Dividing by <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> and A:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{\Delta Q / \Delta t} \over A} = \rho v_d\]</span></p>
<p>Taking the limit as <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t \rightarrow 0\)</span>, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{I \over A} = \rho v_d = |\vec{J}|\]</span></p>
<p>Thus for a wire, the magnitude of the current density is the current/area.</p>
<p>Another way of expressing the current density vector is to use the number of "charge carriers" per volume, <span class="math inline">\(n_q\)</span>. In terms of <span class="math inline">\(n_q\)</span> the charge density is <span class="math inline">\(\rho = n_q q\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is the charge on each "charge carrier". With this notation,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{J} = n_q q \vec{v}_d\]</span></p>
<p>If electrons are the charge carriers, then <span class="math inline">\(n_q\)</span> is the number of electrons per volume, <span class="math inline">\(n_e\)</span>, and the charge on each electron is <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\vec{J} = n_e e \vec{v}_d\)</span>.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Resistance</strong></p>
<p>When we connected the plates of the capacitor with a wire, the charge flowed from one side to the other and the capacitor became neutral again. We "discharged" the capacitor. If we discharge the capacitor with a more "resistive" wire it takes longer for the capacitor to discharge. The current is less, there is more <span><strong>electrical resistance</strong></span> to the flow of charge.</p>
<p>How can we quantify electrical resistance? Resistance is a property of the medium (or material) that the charge is flowing in. For a material to have low resistance, charges must move more easy than a material with high resistance. What makes the charges move? An electrical force, i.e. an electric field. So one can quantify the resistivity of a material by how fast the charges "drift" for a particular electric field. For a given electric field <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> a material with a large resistivity will have a small current density. We can define the resistivity of a material as the ratio of <span class="math inline">\(|\vec{E}|/|\vec{J}|\)</span>. The symbol for resistivity is usually <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, however this is often used to denote density, so we will use <span class="math inline">\(\rho_e\)</span> for electrical resistivity. This is often written as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{J} = {1 \over \rho_e} \vec{E}\]</span></p>
<p>Another useful quantity is the conductivity of a material. The lower the resistance, the larger the conductivity: conductivity = 1/resistance. Conductivity is usually given the symbol <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, but since we also have been using <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> as surface charge density, we will call conductivity <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_e\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sigma_e = {1 \over \rho_e}\]</span></p>
<p>With this definition,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{J} = \sigma_e \vec{E}\]</span></p>
<p>. In the table below we list values of the resistivity for some common conductors at room temperature:</p>

<p>The above microscopic property can be used to determine the electrical properties of a large (macroscopic) piece of the material. Suppose the material is a long cylinder, like a wire. Let the cross sectional area be <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and the length be <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. If the voltage difference between the ends of the material is <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, then the average electric field inside is <span class="math inline">\(E = V/l\)</span>. If the electric field is <span class="math inline">\(V/l\)</span>, then the current density is <span class="math inline">\(J = \sigma_e V/l\)</span>. Since the current <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> in the conductor (wire) is <span class="math inline">\(J A\)</span>, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I = {{\sigma_e A} \over l} V\]</span></p>
<p>This equation is usually written with <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> on the left side of the equation and in terms of <span class="math inline">\(\rho_e\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_e\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V = {{\rho_e l} \over A} I\]</span></p>
<p>The quantity <span class="math inline">\(\rho_e l/A\)</span> is called the resistance of the object and given the symbol <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V = R I\]</span></p>
<p>The resistance of the object is proportional to its length and inversely proportional to its area: <span class="math inline">\(R = \rho_e l/A\)</span>.</p>
<p>The above equation allows one to measure the resistance of an object: establish a voltage difference <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> across the object and measure the current <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> that flows. The resistance is <span class="math inline">\(R = V/I\)</span>. The question we can ask is: Does <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> depend on the amount of current <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> that is flowing through the material? In general, the answer to this question is YES. Often, when more current flows through a material, the material gets hot and the resistance increases. However, for some materials the effects of temperature are small enough that the resistance is approximately constant over a wide range of currents. These kinds of materials are called <span><strong>Ohmic Materials</strong></span>.</p>
<p>For Ohmic materials, <span class="math inline">\(V = RI\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is constant over a wide range of currents. In this course, we will consider currents through Ohmic materials, for which <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is constant.</p>
<p><strong>Capacitor Discharge</strong></p>
<p>If we connect the plates of a charged capacitor with a wire of fixed resistance <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, we can determine how the charge on the capacitor changes in time. Suppose we have a capacitor of capacitance <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, with an initial charge <span class="math inline">\(Q_0\)</span>. At <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> we connect the plates with a wire of resistance <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. What is the charge on the capacitor as a function of time <span class="math inline">\(Q(t)\)</span>? We canâ€™t write an algebraic equation for <span class="math inline">\(Q(t)\)</span>, but we can write an equation that describes how <span class="math inline">\(Q(t)\)</span> changes in time. This can be done as follows:</p>
<p>The voltage across the capacitor and resistor, <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, is related to the current <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> through the resistor as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V = RI\]</span></p>
<p>We now express <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> in terms of the charge <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> on the capacitor: <span class="math inline">\(V = Q/C\)</span> and the current <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is the rate at which the charge is leaving the capacitor: <span class="math inline">\(I = - dQ/dt\)</span>. The minus sign is because if <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is decreasing the current is positive. Substituting into the equation above and re-arrainging terms gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R {{dQ} \over {dt}} = -{Q \over C}\]</span></p>
<p>This is a differential equation for <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. It is an equation relating the rate at which <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> changes to how much charge <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is on the plates. The more charge, the faster it leaves the plates. It is often the case in physics that equations pertaining to the changes in quantities take on a simple form. This is why calculus is so important in physics. Capacitor discharge is such a case.</p>
<p>We will discuss the solution in class. We will show that <span class="math inline">\(Q(t)\)</span> is of exponential form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q(t) = Q_0 e^{-t/(RC)}\]</span></p>
<p>The quantity <span class="math inline">\(RC\)</span> is called the time constant and is the time it takes for the charge to decrease to <span class="math inline">\(1/e\)</span> of its initial value. Since the voltage across the capacitor is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(V = Q/C\)</span>, the voltage across the capacitor also decreases exponentially in time:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V(t) = V_0 e^{-t/(RC)}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(V_0\)</span> is the voltage at time <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>. Experiments on discharging capacitors verify the exponential decay, indicating that the resistance used does not depend on the current through it.</p>
<p><strong>Circuits in General</strong></p>
<p>Capacitors are nice for storing charge as well as other applications, but after the charge has left the plates no more current can flow. If one wants to sustain the current then a battery or other form of power supply must be used. In the case of a battery, a chemical reaction keeps charge available for the circuit. The potential across the battery is determined by the chemical reaction, and therefore as charge flows from one side of the battery to the other side the potential remains constant. <span><strong>An ideal battery keeps a constant electrical potential difference across its terminals</strong></span>, while "supplying" as much charge as necessary to flow in the circuit. The value of the potential difference is determined by the chemical elements used in the battery.</p>
<p>There are only two basic principles needed to analyze <span><strong>steady state circuits</strong></span>. These are called Kirchoffâ€™s Lawâ€™s:<br />
. <span><strong>The sum of the currents going into a junction (of wires) equals the sum of the currents leaving that junction</strong></span>. Another way is to say that the charge flowing into equals the charge flowing out of any junction. This is essentially a statement that charge is conserved.<br />
. <span><strong>The sum of the electrical potential differences around any closed path is zero</strong></span>. Another way is to say this is that the sum of the voltages around a closed path is zero. In terms of the electric field: <span class="math inline">\(\oint \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{r} = 0\)</span>. This is essentially a statement that the electrostatic force is a conservative force. We need to emphasize that this is only true for circuits that donâ€™t have changing magnetic fields. We will discuss the corrections to this "law" for changing currents and/or magnetic fields in the next section.<br />
With these two "laws" we can determine the current through any circuit element as well as the voltage differences between any two points in a circuit once we know the properties of the circuit elements. We will do examples in lecture with circuits made up of just batteries and resistors, as well as some that contain capacitors.</p>
<p>In some cases, we can find the effective resistance for certain combinations of resistors.<br />
<br />
Resistors in parallel have their left sides connected together and their right sides connected together. The current that comes into the parallel set-up will split up and divide through each resistor. Suppose we have two resistors in parallel with resistance <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span>. Label the current through <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(I_1\)</span> and the current through <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(I_2\)</span>. If the current that comes into the combination is <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(I = I_1 + I_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since the right sides are connected together as well as the left sides, the potential difference <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the same across each resistor. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(I_1 = V/R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I_2 = V/R_2\)</span>. If the voltage across the resistors is <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and the total current <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, then the effective resistance of the two resistors is just <span class="math inline">\(R_{equiv} = V/I\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(I = V/R_{equiv}\)</span>. Starting with</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I = I_1 + I_2\]</span></p>
<p>and substituting for the current the voltages divided by the resistances:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{V \over R_{equiv}} = {V \over R_1} + {V \over R_2}\]</span></p>
<p>dividing out the <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>â€™s:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{1 \over R_{equiv}} = {1 \over R_1} + {1 \over R_2}\]</span></p>
<p>If there are more than <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> resistors in parallel the method can be extended:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{1 \over R_{equiv}} = {1 \over R_1} + {1 \over R_2} \cdots\]</span></p>
<p>For resistors in parallel, each resistor has the potential difference across it. Resistors in parallel reduces the resistance. The equivalent resistance for resistors connected in parallel is less than the resistance of any one resistor.</p>
<p><br />
Resistors connected in series are connected like train cars, one after the other. In this case, the current through each resister is the same: <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. The voltage difference across the series of resistors is the sum of the voltage differences across each resistor. If <span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span> is the voltage across the iâ€™th resistor, then</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 \cdots\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the voltage across the series of resistors. If the equivalent resistance of the series is <span class="math inline">\(R_{equiv}\)</span>, then</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R_{equiv} I = R_1 I + R_2 I + R_3 I \cdots\]</span></p>
<p>Since the current <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is the same through each resistor, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R_{equiv} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 \cdots\]</span></p>
<p>For resistors connected in series the current is the same through each one. Placing resistors in series increases the resistance in the circuit.</p>
<p>One of the main ways that energy is transfered to our homes is via electrical circuits, thus the study of energy transfered in electrical circuits is of upmost importance. We consider first the energy transfered by a battery, then we consider resistive elements.<br />
<br />
Consider the flow of charge from one side to the other in a battery. The battery supplys a certain amount of charge at a specific potential difference <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. Suppose after a time interval <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> an amount of charge <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q\)</span> flows from one side of the battery to the other side. When an amount of charge <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q\)</span> moves through a potential difference of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, the energy it acquires is <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q V\)</span>. Thus, in a time interval <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> an amount of energy <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q V\)</span> is supplied by the battery. The energy per unit time is therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q V/ \Delta t\)</span>. The energy per unit time is the power. So the power <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> of the battery is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P = {{\Delta Q V} \over {\Delta t}}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q/ \Delta t\)</span> is the current flowing out of and into the batter, so</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P = I V\]</span></p>
<p>Current times voltage is the rate at which a battery is transfering energy to the circuit. The energy comes from the stored chemical energy in the battery.</p>
<p>The capacity of a battery is often given in units of Amp-hours. For example, D cell batteries have a capacity of around <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> amp-hours. This means that the battery can supply a current of 1 amp for <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> hours, or <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> amp for <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> hours, etc. Since an amp is a Coulomb/sec, <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> amp-hours is 10 Coulombs/sec times 3600 sec = <span class="math inline">\(36000\)</span> Coulombs. The voltage across a D cell is <span class="math inline">\(1.5\)</span> Volts, so the initial energy stored in a typical D cell is <span class="math inline">\((36000)(1.5) = 54000\)</span> Joules. In general, if <span class="math inline">\(AH\)</span> is the capacity of a battery in units of amp-hours, then the stored energy is just <span class="math inline">\((AH) \times 3600 \times V\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the voltage of the battery. The table below gives approximate values for some common batteries.</p>

Consider a resistor of resistance R with a steady current I flowing through it. As with the battery, the energy transfered to an amount of charge <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q\)</span> flowing through the resistor is equal to the potential difference <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> times <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q\)</span>. If the charge is flowing at a steady rate, then the speed with which it exits equals the speed at which it entered. Thus, the charge does not gain any kinetic energy. Where does the energy go? If the charge were subject to an electric field without any material, then it would accelerate and speed up. However, the material slows it down and keeps the charge flowing at a constant speed. Thus, the energy given to the flowing charge is transfered to the material of the resistor. The resistor gains internal energy and its temperature increases.</p>
<p>As with the battery, in a time <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> an amount of energy equal to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q V\)</span> is transfered to the resistor. Therefore, the energy per unit time transfered to the resistor is <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q V/ \Delta t\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q / \Delta t\)</span> is the current flowing through the resistor, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Energy \; Transfer \; rate = VI\]</span></p>
<p>The energy transfered to the resistor makes the resistorâ€™s temperature increase until it transfers energy to the environment in terms of internal energy transfer (heat), light, or other forms of energy. The above equation can be written in terms of the resistance and current:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Energy \; Transfer \; rate = I^2R\]</span></p>
<p>or in terms of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Energy \; Transfer \; rate = {V^2 \over R}\]</span></p>
<p>Energy loss in wires is an important consideration in power lines. To minimize the energy loss, or <span class="math inline">\(I^2R\)</span> loss, the current should be a minimum. Since power is <span class="math inline">\(VI\)</span>, this means that to minimize the energy transfered to the environment (i.e. loss) one should use a LARGE voltage and a small current in the transmission lines. This way <span class="math inline">\(V \times I\)</span> can be large, but <span class="math inline">\(I^2 R\)</span> small.</p>
<p>We close this section with some interesting applications of electrostatics and circuits.</p>
<p><strong>Cost of Electrical Energy</strong></p>
<p>Each month we get a bill for the energy we have used in our homes that was transfered through wires to our houses. The electric company monitors the amount of energy we use. The unit that they use is the kilowatt-hour. This might not seem like an energy unit, but it is. A kilowatt is a rate of energy use: <span class="math inline">\(1 \; kW = 1000 \; Joules/sec\)</span>. An hour (<span class="math inline">\(3600\)</span> sec) is a measure of time, and a rate times a time is an amount:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   1 \; kW-hr &amp; = &amp; 1000 {{Joules} \over sec} \times 3600 \; sec\\
           &amp; = &amp; 3,600,000 \; Joules\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>This seems like a lot of energy, but a Joule is a rather small amount of energy on a human scale. Your body uses about <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> Joules/sec to keep itself going. So a Kw-hr is a fair amount of energy. The cost for a Kw-hr of energy varies from place to place, but is around <span class="math inline">\(14\)</span> cents per Kw-hr. That is a pretty small price for <span class="math inline">\(3,600,000\)</span> Joules. Think how much you pay for the <span class="math inline">\(54,000\)</span> Joules that are contained in a D-cell battery.</p>
<p>To calculate how much it costs to use an appliance, just multiply the Kw times the number of hours and then multiply by <span class="math inline">\(14\)</span> cents.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Stored in a Capacitor</strong></p>
<p>When a capacitor is charged with an amount of charge <span class="math inline">\(+Q\)</span> on one plate and <span class="math inline">\(-Q\)</span> on the other plate it has a certain amount of electrical potential energy. When the capacitor discharges, say through a light bulb, one sees the transfer of this energy. The question we want to consider is how much potential energy does a capacitor of capacitance <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> have when it is charged?</p>
<p>You might guess that the potential energy stored in a charged capacitor is just <span class="math inline">\(VQ\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the potential across the capacitor and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is the charge on its plates. However, this is not correct. As the capacitor is "charging up", initially it is easy to transfer charge from one side to the other. It gets more difficult to transfer charge when there is more charge on the plates.</p>
<p>We can solve the problem in a number of ways. A simple way is to let the charged capacitor discharge through a resistor of resistance <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and add up the energy transfered to the resistor. When a capacitor discharges through a resistor, the charge on the plates decreases as <span class="math inline">\(Q_0 e^{-t/(RC)}\)</span>. The current is <span class="math inline">\(-dQ/dt\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I = {{Q_0} \over {RC}} e^{-t/(RC)}\]</span></p>
<p>Since the energy transfer rate to the resistor is <span class="math inline">\(I^2R\)</span>, the total energy transfer is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Total \; Energy = \int_0^\infty I^2 R dt\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting in for the current we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Total \; Energy = \int_0^\infty {Q^2 \over {RC^2}} e^{-2t/(RC)} dt\]</span></p>
<p>Carrying out the integral gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Total \; Energy = {Q^2 \over {2C}}\]</span></p>
<p>This energy, which was transfered to the resistor, was the amount of energy that was stored in the capacitor. One can express this energy in terms of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> as above, or in terms of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> by substituting <span class="math inline">\(V = Q/C\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  Energy \; in \; Capacitor &amp; = &amp; {Q^2 \over {2C}}\\
                    &amp; = &amp; {{QV} \over 2}\\
                    &amp; = &amp; {{CV^2} \over 2}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Another interesting way to express the energy stored in a capacitor is in terms of the electric field between the plates. For a parallel plate capacitor the magnitude <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> of the electric field is <span class="math inline">\(E=Q/(A \epsilon_0)\)</span>. Writing <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(Q=E A \epsilon_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C=A\epsilon_0 /d\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the spacing between the plates, one has:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Energy \; in \; Capacitor = {{(A \epsilon_0 E)^2} \over {2 (A\epsilon_0)/d)}}\]</span></p>
<p>Simplifying, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Energy \; in \; Capacitor = {{\epsilon_0 E^2} \over 2} \; Ad\]</span></p>
<p>The quantity <span class="math inline">\(Ad\)</span> is the volume inside the capacitor. Thus, the quantity <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0 E^2/2\)</span> is an energy density which depends only on the electric field. It can shown (using vector calculus) that in general the expression <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0 E^2/2\)</span> can be interpreted as the energy density of the electrostatic field. It is often given the symbol <span class="math inline">\(U_E\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[U_E = {{\epsilon_0 E^2} \over 2}\]</span></p>
<p>is the energy density of the electric field. In our upper division course it is shown that this term is part of an energy conservation equation for electromagnetic fields and charges.</p>
<p><strong>Microscopic View of Electric Current</strong></p>
<p>We should consider what is happening at the microscopic level in a wire when current is flowing. If there is an electric field present in the wire, the free electrons will feel a force and accelerate. If the magnitude of the electric field is <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, the acceleration of an electron will be <span class="math inline">\(a = eE/m\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the mass of an electron. The electron will keep accelerating until it is stopped by an atom (or another electron) in the conductor. If we denote <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> of the average time it takes the electron to travel before it is stopped, the average drift velocity is <span class="math inline">\(v_d \approx e E \tau /m\)</span>. If there are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> free electrons per volume, then the current density is <span class="math inline">\(J = n e v_d\)</span>, or</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{J} = {{n e^2 \tau} \over m} \vec{E}\]</span></p>
<p>We see that this simple model predicts that <span class="math inline">\(\vec{J}\)</span> is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> doesnâ€™t depend on the amount of current that is flowing (or temperature), then the material will be Ohmic.</p>
<p>We can get a rough idea of how fast the charge is flowing in a wire. Suppose we have a wire that has a current of one amp and whose diameter is <span class="math inline">\(2 \; mm\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(I =  J A\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(J = n e v_d\)</span>, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I = n e v_d A\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of conduction electrons per <span class="math inline">\(m^3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the area. Solving for the drift velocity <span class="math inline">\(v_d\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[v_d = {I \over {n e \pi r^2}}\]</span></p>
<p>For copper, <span class="math inline">\(n \approx 10^{28}\)</span> electrons/<span class="math inline">\(m^3\)</span>. Using <span class="math inline">\(r = 0.001 \; m\)</span> we obtain <span class="math inline">\(v_d \approx 0.2 \; mm/sec\)</span>.</p>
<p>This (<span class="math inline">\(0.2 \; mm/sec\)</span>) is very slow. Why does the light go on just as the switch is closed? This is because the electric field in the wire is established very fast, roughly at the speed of light. As soon as this happens electrons all throughout the circuit move simultaneously. The free electrons in the light start moving as soon as the switch is closed. Although the drift speed is slow, the current can be large because there are a lot of electrons moving.</p>
