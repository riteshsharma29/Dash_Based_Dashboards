<p><span><strong>Notes on LRC circuits and Maxwell’s Equations</strong></span></p>
</div>
<p>Last quarter, in Phy133, we covered electricity and magnetism. There was not enough time to finish these topics, and this quarter we start where we left off and complete the classical treatment of the electro-magnetic interaction. We begin with a discussion of circuits which contain a capacitor, resistor, and a significant amount of self-induction. Then we will revisit the equations for the electric and magnetic fields and add the final piece, due to Maxwell. As we will see, the missing term added by Maxwell will unify electromagnetism and light. Besides unifying different phenomena and our understanding of physics, Maxwell’s term lead the way to the development of wireless communication, and revolutionized our world.</p>
<p><strong>LRC Circuits</strong></p>
<p>Last quarter we covered circuits that contained batteries and resistors. We also considered circuits with a capacitor plus resistor as well as resistive circuits that has a large amount of self-inductance. The self-inductance was dominated by a coiled element, i.e. an inductor. Now we will treat circuits that have all three properties, capacitance, resistance and self-inductance.</p>
<p>We will use the same "physics" we discussed last quarter pertaining to circuits. There are only two basic principles needed to analyze circuits.<br />
. <span><strong>The sum of the currents going into a junction (of wires) equals the sum of the currents leaving that junction</strong></span>. Another way is to say that the charge flowing into equals the charge flowing out of any junction. This is essentially a statement that charge is conserved.<br />
) The sum of the currents into a junction equals the sum of the currents flowing out of the junction.<br />
The next principle involves the sum of the voltage drops around a closed wire loop. If the current is not changing, the sum is be zero. However, this is only correct if the current is not changing in the circuit. If the current is changing, then path integral of <span class="math inline">\(\oint \vec{E} \cdot \vec{dl}\)</span> is not zero, but rather <span class="math inline">\(- d \Phi_m / dt\)</span>. Thus, the Law involving voltage changes around a closed loop is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum (Voltage \; drops) = - \oint \vec{E} \cdot \vec{dl} = {{d \Phi_m} \over {dt}}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_m\)</span> is the magnetic flux through the closed path of the loop. The direction of adding the voltage drops determines the direction of positive magnetic flux. Last quarter we applied these two laws of physics to circuits containing resistors and capacitors, as well as a circuit containing a resistor and inductor. You should review what was covered. Now we consider a circuit that has a capacitor and an inductor.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
An important application is a circuit that has a large self-inductance and a capacitor. We start with the simplest case. For the circuit to have a large self-inductance, we add a coil (or solenoid) that has an inductance <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. The circuit contains only the capacitor connected to the solenoid. We assume that the self-inductance of the rest of the circuit is negligible compared to the solenoid, so that the net self-inductance of the circuit is <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. If the self-inductance of the circuit is <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, then we have <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_m = LI\)</span>. The sum of the the voltage changes around the loop in the direction of "+" current becomes</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum (Voltage \; drops) = + L {{dI} \over {dt}}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is the current in the circuit. Note that the sign on the right side of the equation is "+" if the direction of voltage changes is in the same direction as the current. It would be minus if the other direction were chosen. Let the capacitor have a capacitance of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\pm Q\)</span> be the charge on the plates of the capacitor. Applying the voltage equation to the voltage changes around the circuit gives:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V_c = L {{d I} \over {dt}}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(V_c\)</span> is the voltage across the capacitor. To solve this equation, we need to have another relationship between <span class="math inline">\(V_c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. Expressing <span class="math inline">\(V_c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> in terms of the charge on the capacitor plates will give us the connection we need. If <span class="math inline">\(\pm Q\)</span> are the charges on each plate of the capacitor, we have <span class="math inline">\(V_c = Q/C\)</span>.</p>
<p>The current is the rate of change of the charge on the capacitor. If we take <span class="math inline">\(+I\)</span> in a direction away from the positive plate of the capacitor, then <span class="math inline">\(I = - (dQ)/(dt)\)</span>. Substituting into the equation above gives:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  V_c &amp; = &amp; L {{d I} \over {dt}}\\
  {Q \over C} &amp; = &amp; -L {{d^2 Q} \over {dt^2}} \\
  {{d^2 Q} \over {dt^2}} &amp; = &amp; - {Q \over {LC}}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The above equation is a relatively simple differential equation. The solution <span class="math inline">\(Q(t)\)</span> is a function whose second derivative is minus itself. Functions with this property are sinusoidal functions. How do we include the factor <span class="math inline">\(1/(LC)\)</span>. We can guess the solution by remembering how the chain rule works. You should verify that the function: <span class="math inline">\(Q(t) = A sin(t/\sqrt{LC})\)</span> as well as the function <span class="math inline">\(Q(t) = B cos(t/\sqrt{LC})\)</span> are solutions to the equation above. Any linear combination of these two solutions is also a solution. So the most general solution is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q(t) = A sin({t \over \sqrt{LC}}) + B cos({t \over \sqrt{LC}})\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are constants that depend on the initial conditions. Since the equation is a second order differential equation, there will be two "integration constants". If the initial conditions are such that the initial charge on the capacitor is <span class="math inline">\(Q_0\)</span> and that the current <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is initially zero, then <span class="math inline">\(B=Q_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A=0\)</span>. For these initial conditions the solution is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q(t) = Q_0 cos({t \over \sqrt{LC}})\]</span></p>
<p>From a knowledge of <span class="math inline">\(Q(t)\)</span>, the voltage across the capacitor and the current in the circuit can be determined. The voltage across the capacitor is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V_c(t) = {Q_0 \over C} cos({t \over \sqrt{LC}}) = V_0 cos({t \over \sqrt{LC}})\]</span></p>
<p>and the current in the circuit is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  I(t) &amp; = &amp; - {{dQ} \over {dt}} \\
  I(t) &amp; = &amp; {Q_0 \over \sqrt{LC}} sin({t \over \sqrt{LC}})\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>These are interesting results. The voltage across the capacitor and the current in the circuit oscillate back and forth. The period <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> of this oscillation is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  {T \over \sqrt{LC}} &amp; = &amp; 2 \pi  \\
  T &amp; = &amp; 2 \pi \sqrt{LC}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The frequency of the oscillation is given by <span class="math inline">\(f = 1/T = 1/(2 \pi \sqrt{LC} )\)</span>. This frequency is the resonance frequency of the circuit. Note that the quantity <span class="math inline">\(1/\sqrt{LC}\)</span> occurs in the argument of the sin (or cos) function. It is convenient to define <span class="math inline">\(\omega_0 \equiv 1/\sqrt{LC}\)</span>. With this definition, we have for <span class="math inline">\(I(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V_c(t)\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  I(t) &amp; = &amp; {Q_0 \over \sqrt{LC}} sin(\omega_0 t)\\
  V_c(t) &amp; = &amp; V_0 cos(\omega_0 t)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\omega_0 \equiv {1 \over \sqrt{LC}}\]</span></p>
<p>A couple of things to note.<br />
) The quantity <span class="math inline">\(\omega_0\)</span> has units of <span class="math inline">\(1/time\)</span>. It enters in the argument of the sinusoidal functions in the same way as angular frequency would be for an object moving in a circle. Nothing is rotating here, and there are no physical angles. So when we refer to <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> as the angular frequency, just think of it as <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi\)</span> times the frequency.<br />
) Both the current in the circuit and <span class="math inline">\(V_c\)</span> are sinusoidal functions, but they are out of phase by <span class="math inline">\(90^\circ\)</span>. One varies as <span class="math inline">\(sin(\omega t)\)</span> and the other as <span class="math inline">\(cos(\omega t)\)</span>.<br />
) Initially <span class="math inline">\(I=0\)</span>, and all the energy is in the electric field of the capacitor, and the magnetic field in the solenoid is zero. Then at <span class="math inline">\(t=T/2\)</span>, there is no charge on the capacitor, the current is maximized, and all the energy is in the magnetic field of the solenoid. The energy is being transfered back and forth between the capacitor (electric field energy) and the inductor (magnetic field energy).<br />
In any real circuit there will be resistance. The energy of the <span class="math inline">\(LC\)</span> circuit will be gradually dissipated by resistive elements. Next we consider what happens if we include resistance in the circuit.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Consider now a series circuit that has a capacitor, capacitance <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, a resistor, resistance <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, and a solenoid, self-inductance <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. As before, we will assume that the self-inductance of the whole circuit is approximately that of the solenoid, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. Let’s also neglect the resistance of the solenoid. Now, we can apply the physics of circuits to the <span class="math inline">\(R-L-C\)</span>-series circuit.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum (Voltage \; drops) = L {{dI} \over {dt}}\]</span></p>
<p>if the path for the voltage changes is in the same direction as the "+" direction of the current. As before, we take the "+" direction of the current <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> to be away from the positive side of the capacitor. Adding up the changes in voltage in the direction of "+" current we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V_c -RI = L {{dI} \over {dt}}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(V_c\)</span> is positive, since the path goes from the negative to the positive side of the capacitor (a gain in voltage). The voltage drop across the resistor is <span class="math inline">\(-RI\)</span> because the path is in the direction of the current (i.e. a drop in voltage). As before, substituting <span class="math inline">\(V_c=Q/C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I=-(dQ/dt)\)</span> gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
 {Q \over C} +  R {{dQ} \over {dt}} &amp; = &amp; -L{{d^2Q} \over {dt^2}} \\
  L{{d^2Q} \over {dt^2}} +  R {{dQ} \over {dt}} + {Q \over C} &amp; = &amp; 0 \\
  {{d^2Q} \over {dt^2}} +  {R \over L} {{dQ} \over {dt}} + {Q \over {LC}} &amp; = &amp; 0 \\
  {{d^2Q} \over {dt^2}} +  {R \over L} {{dQ} \over {dt}} + \omega_0^2 Q &amp; = &amp; 0 \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\omega_0 \equiv 1/\sqrt{LC}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can guess what the solution to the differential equation above should be. With <span class="math inline">\(R=0\)</span>, the solution is sinusoidal. If <span class="math inline">\(L=0\)</span>, the solution is a decaying exponential. So we can guess that the solution might be a sinusoidal function multiplied by a decaying exponential. There are different ways to solve this differential equation. I will show two. The first way is rather complicated, but uses real quantities. The second way is simplier, and uses complex numbers. Complex numbers will be very useful in future calculations.<br />
<br />
From the demonstration shown in class, the voltage across the capacitor appears to be a sinusoidal function of time whose amplitude decreases exponentially. So let’s make a guess and try to find a solution of the form <span class="math inline">\(Q(t) = A e^{-\gamma t}cos(\omega t)\)</span>, where all quanties are real. The constant <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> should depend on the initital charge on the capacitor. We need to see if a solution to the differential equation exists for this ansatz, and if so what are the values of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> in terms of R, C, and L. Differentiating our expression for <span class="math inline">\(Q(t)\)</span> gives:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   Q(t) &amp; = &amp; Ae^{-\gamma t} cos(\omega t)  \\
  {{dQ} \over {dt}} &amp; = &amp; Ae^{-\gamma t} (- \gamma cos(\omega t) - \omega sin(\omega t) ) \\
  {{d^2Q} \over {dt^2}} &amp; = &amp; Ae^{-\gamma t}((\gamma^2-\omega^2)cos(\omega t) +
                              2\omega \gamma sin(\omega t))\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Now, substituting <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(dQ/(dt)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(d^2Q/(dt^2)\)</span> into the differential equation, gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
 Ae^{-\gamma t}((\gamma^2 - \omega^2 - R\gamma /L)cos(\omega t) + (2\omega \gamma -R\omega /L)sin(\omega t)) &amp; =0\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>This equation must be true for all times <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Therefore the terms multiplying the <span class="math inline">\(sin(\omega t)\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(cos(\omega t)\)</span> must each be equal to zero:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   \gamma^2 - \omega^2 - R\gamma /L + \omega_0^2 &amp; = &amp; 0\\
   \omega (2\gamma -R/L) &amp; = &amp; 0\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The condition that these two equations to be valid require that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  2\gamma - R/L &amp; = &amp; 0 \\
   \gamma &amp; = &amp; {R \over {2L}}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
 \gamma^2 - \omega^2 - R\gamma /L + \omega_0^2 &amp; = &amp; 0 \\
 {R^2 \over {4L^2}} - \omega^2 - {R^2 \over {2L^2}} +\omega_0^2 &amp; = &amp; 0 \\
   \omega^2 &amp; = &amp; \omega_0^2 - {R^2 \over {4L^2}} \\
   \omega &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{\omega_0^2 -(R/(2L))^2}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>So, our solution for the <span class="math inline">\(LRC\)</span> decaying circuit is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  Q(t) &amp; = &amp; A e^{-R/(2L)}(Acos(\sqrt{\omega_0^2 - (R/(2L))^2} \; t) \\
  Q(t) &amp; = &amp; A e^{-\gamma t} cos (\omega t)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Using the sin function in place of the cos function will also yield a solution to the differential equation. Thus, the most general solution is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  Q(t) &amp; = &amp; e^{-R/(2L)}(Acos(\sqrt{\omega_0^2 - (R/(2L))^2} \; t) +
                         Bsin(\sqrt{\omega_0^2 - (R/(2L))^2} \; t)) \\
  Q(t) &amp; = &amp; A_0 e^{-\gamma t} cos (\omega t + \alpha)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = R/(2L)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega = \sqrt{\omega_0^2-\gamma^2}\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are determined from the initial conditions (i.e. at <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>) of the circuit. For the last step, we have combined a sin plus cos into a cos plus an angle. In terms of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, the constant <span class="math inline">\(A_0 = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(tan(\alpha) = -B/A\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    A_0 cos(\omega t + \alpha) &amp; = &amp; A_0cos(\omega t) cos(\alpha) -A_0sin(\omega t)sin(\alpha) \\
                     &amp; = &amp; A_0cos(\omega t) ({A \over A_0}) - A_0sin(\omega t)({{-B} \over A_0}) \\
                     &amp; = &amp; Acos(\omega t) + Bsin(\omega t)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are two legs of a right triangle. The hypotenuse is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}=A_0\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(cos(\alpha) = A/A_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(sin(\alpha)=-B/A_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>The math using real quantities is somewhat complicated. Now let’s do the same thing with complex numbers.<br />
<br />
The mathematical relationship that we use is "Euler’s Equation":</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[e^{ix} = cos(x) + i sin(x)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is real and <span class="math inline">\(i=\sqrt{-1}\)</span>. Guided by the reasoning we used with real numbers, we look for a solution of the form <span class="math inline">\(Q(t) = Re(ze^{\beta t})\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> are constants that are complex numbers. Note, the solution <span class="math inline">\(Q(t)\)</span> is real since we are taking the real part (Re) of a complex number. First, I’ll show that the form we have chosen results in the same form as with the real numbers. Since <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is complex, we can write it as <span class="math inline">\(z=A_0e^{i \alpha}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> are real. Since <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is complex, we can write it as <span class="math inline">\(\beta = - \gamma + i \omega\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> are real. So, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  Q(t) &amp; = &amp; Re(A_0e^{i\alpha}e^{(-\gamma + i \omega)t}) \\
       &amp; = &amp; Re(A_0 e^{-\gamma t} e^{i(\omega t + \alpha)}) \\
       &amp; = &amp; A_0 e^{-\gamma t} Re(e^{i(\omega t + \alpha)}) \\
       &amp; = &amp; A_0 e^{-\gamma t} cos(\omega t + \alpha)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>which is of the same form as that using the real parameters. That is, <span class="math inline">\(Re(\beta ) \rightarrow
-\gamma\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Im(\beta ) \rightarrow \omega\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>) is a complex constant that depends on the initial conditions as before.</p>
<p>To make the math somewhat easier, let’s choose <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> to be real. In this case we have <span class="math inline">\(Q(t)=Re(Ae^{\beta t})\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is real and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is complex. We can now substitute the function <span class="math inline">\(Ae^{\beta t}\)</span> into the differential equation and find a solution. Since the real and imaginary parts are independent, they will each satisfy the differential equation. Both the real and imaginary parts will be solutions for <span class="math inline">\(Q(t)\)</span>, and we will take the real part. Substituting <span class="math inline">\(Ae^{\beta t}\)</span> into our differential equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
A({{d^2e^{\beta t}} \over {dt^2}} +  {R \over L} {{de^{\beta t}} \over {dt}} + 
            \omega_0^2 e^{\beta t})) &amp; = &amp; 0 \\
{{d^2e^{\beta t}} \over {dt^2}} +  {R \over L} {{de^{\beta t}} \over {dt}} + 
            \omega_0^2 e^{\beta t} &amp; = &amp; 0 \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The constant <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> factors out of each term since it is a constant. Differentiating the exponential functions is easy:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
e^{\beta t} ( \beta^2 +  {R \over L} \beta +   \omega_0^2 ) &amp; = &amp; 0 \\
        \beta^2 +  {R \over L} \beta +   \omega_0^2  &amp; = &amp; 0 \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>and we are left with a quadratic equation for <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, whose solution is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \beta &amp; = &amp; {{-R/L \pm \sqrt{(R/L)^2 - 4 \omega_0^2}} \over 2} \\
        &amp; = &amp; -{R \over {2L}} \pm \sqrt{({R \over {2L}})^2 - \omega_0^2}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>If the resistance is small such that <span class="math inline">\(R/(2L) &lt; \omega_0\)</span>, then the argument in the square root is negative. Defining <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = R/(2L)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \gamma^2}\)</span> we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\beta = -\gamma \pm i \omega\]</span></p>
<p>We take the real part of <span class="math inline">\(ze^{\beta t}\)</span> for Q(t):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   Q(t) &amp; = &amp; Re(A e^{(-\gamma \pm i \omega)t}) \\
        &amp; = &amp; A \; Re(e^{(-\gamma \pm i \omega)t}) \\
        &amp; = &amp; A \; Re(e^{-\gamma t} e^{\pm i \omega t} ) \\
        &amp; = &amp; A e^{-\gamma t} Re(e^{\pm i (\omega t} ) \\
        &amp; = &amp; A e^{-\gamma t} cos(\omega t )\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>which is the same result we obtained using only real quantities. Using complex numbers greatly simplifies the solution. We will use complex numbers a few more times this quarter to solve differential equations and to add sinusoidal functions having the same frequency.</p>
<p>A final point mention is that only <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> depend on the circuit elements <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</p>
<p>Next we will consider an <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> circuit that has a sinusoidal voltage source.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As a final example of <span class="math inline">\(LRC\)</span> series circuits, we will add a sinusoidal voltage source to the circuit. Let’s first start with a circuit that has a self-inductance <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and a resistance <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. The self-inductance is dominated by a solenoid as before. Let the frequency of the sinusoidal voltage source be <span class="math inline">\(f_d = \omega_d /(2 \pi)\)</span>, and the maximum voltage be <span class="math inline">\(V_m\)</span>.</p>
<p>The same physics is true when there is a source of voltage present: 1) the current is the same through each circuit element since they are connected in series, and 2) the sum of the voltage changes around the loop equals the change of magnetic flux. Since the voltage source is sinusoidal, after any transient oscillations have damped out, the current in <span><em>the circuit will also be sinusoidal with the same frequency as the voltage source</em></span>. That is, the current through every element in the circuit can be written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I(t) = I_m cos(\omega_d t)\]</span></p>
<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(I_m\)</span> is the maximum amplitude that the current will have. We could have also chosen <span class="math inline">\(sin(\omega_d t)\)</span> and the end results would be the same. What we need to determine is the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(V_m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I_m\)</span>, and the relative phase between the sinusoidal current and the sinusoidal voltages. For this, we use the voltage sum law. Equating the voltage changes around the loop to the change in magnetic flux through the loop gives:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   V_d -IR &amp; = &amp; L {{dI} \over {dt}} \\
   V_d &amp; = &amp; IR + L{{dI} \over {dt}}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where the current <span class="math inline">\(I(t)\)</span> is the same through the resistor and the solenoid. If <span class="math inline">\(I(t)=I_m cos(\omega_d t)\)</span>, then the voltage source satisfies</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   V_d &amp; = &amp; IR + L{{dI} \over {dt}} \\
   V_d &amp; = &amp; I_m R cos(\omega_d t) - L\omega_d I_m sin(\omega_d t) \\
   V_d &amp; = &amp; I_m ( R cos(\omega_d t) - L\omega_d sin(\omega_d t)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>We can simplify this expression by adding the sin and cos functions. A nice property of sinusoidal functions having the same frequency is that when they are added together the sum is a single sinusoidal function. We demonstrate this property for our circuit by using the trig identity <span class="math inline">\(cos(\omega_d t + \phi) = cos(\omega_d t)cos(\phi)-sin(\omega t)sin(\phi)\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   V_d &amp; = &amp; I_m ( R cos(\omega_d t) - L\omega_d sin(\omega_d t)) \\
   V_d &amp; = &amp; I_m \sqrt{R^2+(L\omega_d)^2} ({R \over {\sqrt{R^2+(L\omega_d)^2}}}
   cos(\omega_d t) - {{L\omega_d} \over {\sqrt{R^2+(L\omega_d)^2}}} sin(\omega_d t))\\
   V_d &amp; = &amp; I_m \sqrt{R^2+(L\omega_d)^2}( cos(\phi)cos(\omega_d t) - sin(\phi) sin(\omega_d t)) \\
   V_d &amp; = &amp; I_m \sqrt{R^2+(L\omega_d)^2} \; cos(\omega_d t + \phi) \\ \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The third line follows by noting that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L\omega_d\)</span> are two legs of a right triangle. The hypotenuse of this right triangle is <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{R^2 + (L\omega_d)^2}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is an angle in the triangle. Since the cos function varies between <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>, the amplitude of the voltage source is <span class="math inline">\(V_m = I_m \sqrt{R^2 + (L\omega_d)^2}\)</span>, and the voltage of the source <span><em>leads</em></span> the current by a phase <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(tan(\phi) = L\omega_d /R\)</span>.<br />
Now let’s add a capacitor in series with the resistor and solenoid. We need to determine what the voltage <span class="math inline">\(V_c\)</span> across the capacitor is when a sinusoidal current <span class="math inline">\(I_m cos(\omega_d t\)</span> flows through it. We know <span class="math inline">\(V_c = Q/C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I=+dQ/(dt)\)</span>. Here there is a <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> sign in front of <span class="math inline">\(dQ/(dt)\)</span> since current is flowing into the capacitor. Solving for <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   {{dQ} \over {dt}} &amp; = &amp; I_m ;\ cos(\omega_d t) \\
     Q &amp; = &amp; \int I_m \; cos(\omega_d t) \; dt  \\
     Q &amp; = &amp; {I_m \over \omega_d} sin(\omega_d t) \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The integrating constant will be the initial charge on the capacitor, which we take to be zero. Since <span class="math inline">\(V_c = Q/C\)</span>, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V_c = {I_m \over {\omega_d C}} sin(\omega_d t)\]</span></p>
<p>Adding the voltage changes around the <span class="math inline">\(RLC\)</span> series circuit loop gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   V_d -IR - V_c &amp; = &amp; L {{dI} \over {dt}} \\
   V_d &amp; = &amp; IR + L{{dI} \over {dt}} + V_c\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The current through each element is <span class="math inline">\(I=I_m \; cos(\omega_d t)\)</span>, which yields for the voltages:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   V_d &amp; = &amp; I_m R cos(\omega_d t)-L\omega_d I_m sin(\omega_d t)+{I_m \over {\omega_d C}} sin(\omega_d t)\\
   V_d &amp; = &amp; I_m R cos(\omega_d t)-I_m(L\omega_d-{1 \over {\omega_d C}}) sin(\omega_d t)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Finally, we can combine the sin and cos terms into one sinusoidal function as we did before with only the solenoid present.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V_d = I_m \sqrt{R^2+(L\omega_d - {1 \over {\omega_d C}})^2} \; cos(\omega_d t + \phi)\]</span></p>
<p>where now</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[tan(\phi ) = {{L\omega_d - {1 \over {\omega_d C}}} \over R}\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s discuss our results.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The quantity <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{R^2+(L\omega_d-1/(\omega_d C))^2}\)</span> plays the role of resistance in our series AC sinusoidal circuit. This generalized resistance quantity is called the <span><em>impedance</em></span> of the circuit and usually given the symbol <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z \equiv \sqrt{R^2+(L\omega_d - {1 \over {\omega_d C}})^2}\]</span></p>
<p>Remember, however, that <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> only has meaning for sinusoidal currents and voltage sources. If <span class="math inline">\(L=0\)</span> and in the absence of a capacitor, <span class="math inline">\(Z=R\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(V_m=I_m Z\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The term <span class="math inline">\(L\omega_d\)</span> is called the inductive reactance, and usually labeled as <span class="math inline">\(X_L \equiv L\omega_d\)</span>. The inductive reactance has units of resistance (Ohms) and represents the effective inductive resistance of the solenoid for sinusoidal currents.</p></li>
<li><p>The term <span class="math inline">\(1/(\omega_d C)\)</span> is called the capacitive reactance, and usually labeled as <span class="math inline">\(X_C \equiv 1/(\omega_d C)\)</span>. The capacitive reactance has units of resistance (Ohms) and represents the effective capacitive resistance of the capacitor for sinusoidal currents.</p></li>
<li><p>With these definitions, <span class="math inline">\(Z=\sqrt{R^2+(X_L-X_C)^2}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(tan(\phi)=(X_L-X_C)/R\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>For high driving frequencies, <span class="math inline">\(X_L=\omega_d L\)</span> is the largest term. The circuit is mainly inductive. For low driving frquencies, <span class="math inline">\(X_C=1/(\omega_d C)\)</span> is the largest term, and the circuit is mainly capacitative.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(X_L &gt; X_C\)</span> (an inductive "<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>" situation) the relative phase <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> between the voltage and the current is positive: voltage leads current. If <span class="math inline">\(X_C &gt; X_L\)</span> (a capacitive "<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>" situation) the relative phase <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> between the voltage the current is negative: current leads voltage. Now you know about "ELI the ICE man".</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> becomes its smallest when <span class="math inline">\(X_L=X_C\)</span>. In this case <span class="math inline">\(Z=R\)</span>. The frequency for which this occurs is called the resonant frequency. <span class="math inline">\(X_L=X_C\)</span>, i.e. the resonance condition, when the driving angular frequency is <span class="math inline">\(\omega_d=1/\sqrt{LC}\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(f_d = 1/(2\pi \sqrt{LC})\)</span>. At this resonant frequency, the impedance takes on its smallest value and one gets the most current for the least voltage.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There is a nice geometric way to express the impedance using a "phasor diagram". <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> points along the "+x-axis", <span class="math inline">\(X_L\)</span> points along the "+y-axis", and <span class="math inline">\(X_C\)</span> points along the <span class="math inline">\(-y-axis\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> are found by adding the reactances and resistance like vectors.</p>
<p><img src="fig2341a.png" style="width:14cm" alt="image" /></p>
<p>One can do the analysis using complex numbers, if there is time I will cover this in class. For those interested, <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> as well as <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(V_m\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I_m\)</span> will be complex numbers. The current is <span class="math inline">\(I=I_m e^{i\omega_m t}\)</span>, and the voltage is <span class="math inline">\(V=V_m e^{i\omega t}\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is real, but <span class="math inline">\(X_L = i\omega_d L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_C = -i/(\omega_d C)\)</span>. For a series connection, the complex impedance is <span class="math inline">\(Z = R + i(\omega_d L - 1/(\omega_d C))\)</span>. The complex numbers <span class="math inline">\(V_m\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(I_m\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> are related by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
     V &amp; = &amp; IZ \\
    V_m e^{i\omega_d t} &amp; = &amp; I_me^{i\omega_d t} Z \\
    V_m &amp; = &amp; I_m Z \\
    V_m &amp; = &amp; I_m \sqrt{R^2 + (\omega_d L - {1 \over {\omega_d C}})^2} \;  e^{i \phi}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Taking the real parts of each side yields the same result we obtained using real numbers. For circuits that are combinations of series and parallel connections, using complex numbers makes the calculations much much easier.</p>
<p><br />
Energy will only be transfered into the resistive element in the circuit. Last quarter we derived that the power <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> transfered into a resistor with resistance <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(P = I^2 R\)</span>. A sinusoidal voltage produces a sinusoidal current, so the power varies in time as a sinusoidal squared function. If <span class="math inline">\(I = I_m sin(\omega_m t)\)</span>, then the power is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P = I_m^2 R sin^2(\omega_m t)\]</span></p>
<p>and varies in time. We can calculate the average power, <span class="math inline">\(P_{ave}\)</span> by averaging <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> over one period of oscillation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_{ave} = I_m^2 R ({1 \over T}) \int_0^T sin^2({{2\pi} \over T} t) dt\]</span></p>
<p>We will show in lecture that the average of <span class="math inline">\(sin^2\)</span> over one cycle equals <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>. So we have for the average power:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_{ave} = {{I_m^2 R} \over 2}\]</span></p>
<p>It is convenient to express the power in terms of the R.M.S. (Root Mean Square) value of the current (or voltage). The R.M.S. value means the square Root of the average (Mean) value of the Square of the function. For a sinusoidally varying function, the R.M.S. value equals <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> the value of the maximum. So,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    I_{RMS} &amp; = &amp; {I_m \over \sqrt{2}} \\
    V_{RMS} &amp; = &amp; {V_m \over \sqrt{2}}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>in terms of the R.M.S. values,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  P_{ave} &amp; = &amp; I_{RMS}^2 R \\
          &amp; = &amp; I_{RMS}{V_{RMS} \over Z}R \\
          &amp; = &amp; I_{RMS} V_{RMS} cos(\phi)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>since <span class="math inline">\(cos(\phi) = R/Z\)</span>.</p>
<p>In summary, there are three different types of circuit components. One type are resistive elements, which have <span class="math inline">\(V_R \propto I\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(V=RI\)</span>). Another type are inductive elements, which have <span class="math inline">\(V_L \propto dI/(dt)\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(V_L = L (dI/(dt))\)</span>). A third type are capacitive elements, which have <span class="math inline">\(I \propto dV_C/(dt)\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(I = (1/C)(dV_C/(dt))\)</span>). <span><em>If the current through the circuit element is <span class="math inline">\(I=I_m \; cos(\omega_d t)\)</span></em></span> then,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  V_R(t) &amp; = &amp; R I_m \; cos(\omega_d t) \; (Resistive) \\
  V_L(t) &amp; = &amp; - L \omega_d \; sin(\omega_d t) \; = 
                              L \omega_d cos(\omega_dt+\pi /2)(Inductive) \\
  V_C(t) &amp; = &amp;  {1 \over {C \omega_d}} \; sin(\omega t) \; = 
                             {1 \over {C\omega_d}}cos(\omega_dt-\pi /2) (Capacitative)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>In series, the voltages (and resistances) add like vectors (phasors) because the sum of two sinusoidals that have the same frequency is itself a sinusoidal with the same frequency. From the equations above we can see that across an inductor the voltage leads the current by <span class="math inline">\(90^\circ\)</span>. Across a capacitor, the voltage lags the current by <span class="math inline">\(90^\circ\)</span>. A catchy phrase to remember this is "ELI the ICE man". For an inductor L, E leads I. For a capacitor C, I leads E.</p>
<p><strong>Maxwell’s Equations</strong></p>
<p>The equations for the electromagnetic fields that we have developed so far, in Phy133, are best expessed in terms of line and surface integrals:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
 \oint \oint \vec{E} \cdot \vec{dA} &amp; = &amp; {{Q_{net}} \over \epsilon_0} \; \; (Coulomb)\\
  \oint \oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dA} &amp; = &amp; 0  \\
 \oint \vec{E} \cdot \vec{dr} &amp; = &amp; - {{d \Phi_B} \over {dt}} \; \;  (Faraday)\\
  \oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dr} &amp; = &amp; \mu_0 I_{net}   \; \; (Ampere ) \\\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Maxwell realized that the equations above are inconsistent with charge conservation. In particular, there is a problem with the equation refered to as Ampere’s Law:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dr} =  \mu_0 I_{net}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(I_{net}\)</span> is the net current that passes through the path of the line integral <span class="math inline">\(\oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dr}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can demonstrate the problem by considering the magnetic field that is produced by a charging parallel plate capacitor. Let the capacitor have circular plates with a radius <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, and a plate separation <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. Let the wires that connect to the center of the plates extend to <span class="math inline">\(\pm \infty\)</span>. See the figure on the adjacent page. Suppose the right plate has charge <span class="math inline">\(+Q(t)\)</span> and the left plate a charge of <span class="math inline">\(-Q(t)\)</span>. Suppose also that charge is flowing into the left plate and out of the right plate.</p>
<p>Suppose for a certain time period the current flowing into the plates is a constant, with value <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. This current will produce a magnetic field that will circulate the wire. If <span class="math inline">\(d&lt;&lt;R\)</span>, the magnetic field a distance <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> from the wire will have a magnitude of <span class="math inline">\(B \approx \mu_0 I/(2 \pi R)\)</span>. Last quarter we derived this from the Biot-Savart Law. Since <span class="math inline">\(d&lt;&lt;R\)</span>, the magnetic field will also exist and have roughly this value at the edge (in the middle) of the capacitor. That is, a distance <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> from the axis and a distance <span class="math inline">\(d/2\)</span> from one side.</p>
<p>Now, let’s apply Ampere’s law for a circular path, radius <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, in the middle of the capacitor.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dr} &amp; = &amp; \mu_0 I_{net} \\
  B (2 \pi R) &amp; = &amp; \mu_0 I_{net} = 0 \\
   B &amp; = &amp; 0  \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The last line equals zero since there is no physical current going through the circular path. The direct surface of the path lies inside the capacitor (i.e. between the plates). There is no physical current flowing between the plates. If we choose a different surface, a curved surface (like a sock) that goes outside the plates and intersects the wire, then a physical current <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> would go through this "sock-like" surface. The way Ampere’s law is stated above, it appears that one gets different results depending on the surface one chooses for "through the path".</p>
<p>Maxwell realized that there is a term missing from Ampere’s law. For now, let’s call this term <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and reconsider Ampere’s law with the surface being a flat circular surface through the middle of the capacitor.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dr} &amp; = &amp; \mu_0 I_{net} + M \\
  B (2 \pi R) &amp; = &amp; \mu_0 I_{net} + M \\
 {{\mu_0 I} \over {2 \pi R}} (2 \pi R) &amp; = &amp; 0 + M \\
    M &amp; = &amp; \mu_0 I  \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>So the missing term must equal <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0 I\)</span>, as if the wire went right through the capacitor. But, there is no physical current between the capacitor plates. There is only an Electric field. We can express <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> in terms of the electric field between the plates. Since <span class="math inline">\(I = dQ/(dt)\)</span>, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   M &amp; = &amp; \mu_0 I \\
     &amp; = &amp; \mu_0 {{dQ} \over {dt}} \\
     &amp; = &amp; \mu_0 {{d(\epsilon_0 A E)} \over {dt}}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>since the electric field between the capacitor plates is <span class="math inline">\(E=Q/(A \epsilon_0)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the area of the plates. With this substitution, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}

   M &amp; = &amp; \mu_0 \epsilon_0  {{d\phi_E} \over {dt}}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\phi_E\)</span> is the electric flux through the flat surface in the middle of the plates. Maxwell realized that if we add this term to Ampere’s law, then the law is consistent with any surface that is chosen on the right side. The corrected equation is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dr} = \mu_0 I_{net} + \epsilon_0 \mu_0 {{d\phi_E} \over {dt}} \\\]</span></p>
<p>For the charging parallel plate capacitor the problem is resolved. If one chooses the "sock" surface (outside the capacitor), there is a physical current that goes through the surface. The first term on the right is <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0 I\)</span> and the second term is zero since there is no electric field outside the capacitor. If one chooses the flat surface that goes through the capacitor, the first term is zero since there is no physical current through this surface. However, the second term is <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0 I\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0 (d\phi_E)/(dt)\)</span> through this surface equals <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. Maxwell named the quantity <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0 d\phi_E /(dt)\)</span> as "displacement current".</p>
<p>Some things to note:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>At the time, there was no experimental evidence for the displacement current term in <span class="math inline">\(\oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dr}\)</span>. Maxwell used purely theoretical reasoning to justify its existance.</p></li>
<li><p>It might not be clear from our arguments how charge conservation enters the reasoning. When the field equations are expressed in differential form (junior level physics), it will become clearer. Without the displacement current Ampere’s law would be <span class="math inline">\(Curl(\vec{B}) = \mu_0 \vec{J}\)</span>. Since the Divergence of a Curl is always zero, we would have <span class="math inline">\(Div(\vec{J}) = 0\)</span>. Charge conservation requires that <span class="math inline">\(Div(\vec{J}) = \partial \rho / (dt)\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(Div(\vec{E}) = \rho /\epsilon_0\)</span>, the changing electric flux term restores charge conservation.</p></li>
<li><p>In our charging capacitor example, only one of the two terms were non-zero at a time. In general, both terms can be non-zero at the same time. We will discuss an example in class. That is, a magnetic field can be produced by a "real current" and the second "displacement current" piece at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>You might wonder why the displacement current term was not discovered experimentally, as was Faraday’s law. The reason it was not initially observed is that it is much smaller than the <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0 I\)</span> piece since <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0\)</span> is relatively small.</p></li>
<li><p>You might be conderned that the choice of surface may be important in Faraday’s Law, and that perhaps a term is also missing from the equation <span class="math inline">\(\oint \vec{E} \cdot \vec{dl} = -(d \phi_B)/(dt)\)</span>. There is not. Since there are no sources for <span class="math inline">\(\vec{B}\)</span>, any valid surface you pick for applying Faraday’s law will give the same answer.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We state here the complete set of source equations (in integral form) for the electric and magnetic fields:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
 \oint \oint \vec{E} \cdot \vec{dA} &amp; = &amp; {{Q_{net}} \over \epsilon_0} \; \; (Coulomb)\\
  \oint \oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dA} &amp; = &amp; 0  \\
 \oint \vec{E} \cdot \vec{dr} &amp; = &amp; - {{d \Phi_B} \over {dt}} \; \;  (Faraday)\\
  \oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dr} &amp; = &amp; \mu_0 I_{net} + \epsilon_0 \mu_0 {{d \Phi_E} \over {dt}}
        \; \; (Ampere + Maxwell) \\\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>These equations are refered to as "Maxwell’s Equations" for the classical electrodynamic fields. The force equation <span class="math inline">\(F = q \vec{E} + q (\vec{v} \times \vec{B})\)</span> relates the force to the fields. Maxwell added the missing piece in 1864. As we shall see in the next section, his contribution unified the electric-magnetic interaction with light (or more generally electromagnetic radiation). Radio, television, and wireless communication were made possible from an understanding of these equations once the displacement current piece was added.</p>
<p><strong>Electromagnetic Radiation</strong></p>
<p>Let’s consider solutions to Maxwell’s equations in empty space, where there is no charge and no real currents. That is, in a region where all closed surface integerals do not contain any charge, and where there is no real current flowing through any closed path. In this case, Maxwell’s equations become:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
 \oint \oint \vec{E} \cdot \vec{dA} &amp; = &amp; 0 \\
  \oint \oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dA} &amp; = &amp; 0  \\
 \oint \vec{E} \cdot \vec{dr} &amp; = &amp; - {{d \Phi_B} \over {dt}} \\
  \oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dr} &amp; = &amp; \epsilon_0 \mu_0 {{d \Phi_E} \over {dt}} \\\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{B}\)</span> do not have any time dependence, then there are zeros on the right side of each equation. This is the "static" case in which all the free charge and currents don’t change in time. In this case <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{B}\)</span> can be calculated independent of each other. Let’s try and find a simple time-dependent solution for <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> in free space. The simplest case is an electric field that only points in one direction, say the "y" direction <span class="math inline">\(\hat{j}\)</span>. Since the surface integral of <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> for a closed surface equals zero, <span class="math inline">\(E_y\)</span> cannot change in the y-direction. So, <span class="math inline">\(E_y\)</span> can only change in a direction perpendicular to the y-axis. So, with little loss of generality, we can choose <span class="math inline">\(E_y\)</span> to vary in the "x" direction. That is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{E} = E_y(x,t) \hat{j}\]</span></p>
<p>We now carry out <span class="math inline">\(\oint \vec{E} \cdot \vec{dr}\)</span> around a small rectangle in the x-y plane. If the sides of the rectangle are <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta y\)</span>, we have</p>
<p><img src="fig2341b.png" style="width:14cm" alt="image" /></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
 \oint \vec{E} \cdot \vec{dr} &amp; = &amp; - {{d \Phi_B} \over {dt}} \\
 E_y(x+\Delta x)(\Delta y)-E_y(x)(\Delta y) +0 +0 &amp; = &amp; -{{d ((\Delta x)(\Delta y) B_z)} \over {dt}} \\
 (\Delta y)(E_y(x+\Delta x)-E_y(x)) &amp; = &amp; -(\Delta x)(\Delta y) {{d B_z} \over {dt}} \\ 
 (\Delta y)(\Delta x){{dE_y} \over {dx}} &amp; = &amp; -(\Delta x)(\Delta y) {{d B_z} \over {dt}} \\
 {{dE_y} \over {dx}} &amp; = &amp; - {{d B_z} \over {dt}} \\\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Two of the legs on the left side are zero, since <span class="math inline">\(\vec{dr}\)</span> is in the x-direction, but <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> is in the y-direction. Only the legs in the y-direction contribute to the line integral on the left. On the right, the area for the magnetic flux is in the x-y plane, so only the z-component of <span class="math inline">\(\vec{B}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B_z\)</span> contributes. So we see that the z-component of the magnetic field is related to the y-component of the electric field.</p>
<p>The simplest solution will have <span class="math inline">\(\vec{B} = B_z \hat{k}\)</span>. Since the surface integral of <span class="math inline">\(\vec{B}\)</span> for a closed surface equals zero, <span class="math inline">\(B_z\)</span> cannot change in the z-direction. Let’s consider a solution that has <span class="math inline">\(B_z\)</span> only a function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> as with <span class="math inline">\(E_y\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{B} = B_z(x,t) \hat{k}\]</span></p>
<p>We now carry out <span class="math inline">\(\oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dr}\)</span> around a small rectangle in the x-z plane. If the sides of the rectangle are <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta z\)</span>, we have a similar result as with <span class="math inline">\(E_y\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
 \oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dr} &amp; = &amp; \mu_0 \epsilon_0 {{d \Phi_E} \over {dt}} \\
B_z(x)(\Delta z)-B_z(x+\Delta x)(\Delta z) +0 +0 &amp; = &amp; \mu_0 \epsilon_0 {{d ((\Delta z)(\Delta x) E_y)} 
\over {dt}} \\
 -(\Delta z)(B_z(x+\Delta x)-B_z(x)) &amp; = &amp; \mu_0 \epsilon_0(\Delta z)(\Delta x) {{d E_y} \over {dt}} \\ 
 -(\Delta z)(\Delta x){{dB_z} \over {dx}} &amp; = &amp; \mu_0 \epsilon_0 (\Delta x)(\Delta z) {{d E_y} \over {dt}} \\
 {{dB_z} \over {dx}} &amp; = &amp; -\mu_0 \epsilon_0 {{d E_y} \over {dt}} \\\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Once again, the z-component of the magnetic field is related to the y-component of the electric field. We can eliminate <span class="math inline">\(B_z\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(E_y\)</span>) from these equations by diffentiating the first equation with respect to x:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{\partial^2 E_y} \over {\partial x^2}} = - {{\partial^2 B_z} \over {\partial x \partial t}}\]</span></p>
<p>and the second equation with respect to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{\partial^2 B_z} \over {\partial x \partial t}} = -\mu_0 \epsilon_0 {{\partial^2 E_y} \over 
{\partial t^2}}\]</span></p>
<p>Combining these two equations gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{\partial^2 E_y} \over {\partial x^2}} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 {{\partial^2 E_y} \over {\partial t^2}}\]</span></p>
<p>This is a "wave equation". The solution is wave traveling in the <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> x-direction with a speed of <span class="math inline">\(v=1/\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(E_y(x,t) = f(x \pm vt)\)</span> for any function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. A similar "wave equation" results for <span class="math inline">\(B_z\)</span> by differentiating the first equation with respect to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and the second one with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{\partial^2 B_z} \over {\partial x^2}} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 {{\partial^2 B_z} \over {\partial t^2}}\]</span></p>
<p>The speed of these electromagnetic disturbances travel at a speed <span class="math inline">\(v=1/\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}\)</span>. When the electromagnetic constants are plugged in, one gets the speed to be <span class="math inline">\(v=1/\sqrt{(4 \pi \times 10^{-7})(8.85 \times 10^{-12})} \approx 3 \times 10^8 \; m/s\)</span>. One has to believe that it is no accident that the two constants <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span> are related to the speed of light as <span class="math inline">\(c=1/\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}\)</span>, and that light is an electromagnetic disturbance (wave).</p>
<p>Maxwell’s discovery that light is part of the electric and magnetic interaction led to a dramatic change in human life on earth. With a knowledge of the nature of light, we can understand how electromagnetic radiation can be produced and detected. We can see from the equations above that the traveling wave requires that both <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{B}\)</span> depend on time. That is, radiation will not be produced from stationary charge sources or steady currents. Even a charged object moving at a constant velocity will not radiate, since the object will be at rest in an inertial frame moving (at constant velocity) with the object. So, in order to produce electromagnetic radiation (classically from Maxwell’s equations) <span><em>charged objects need to be accelerated</em></span>. In order to sustain the radiation, charged objects, i.e. electrons, will need to move in a circle or "back and forth". Thus, most of the radiation produced classically can be characterized by its frequency. Although the radiation might not be exactly sinusoidal in time (AM is modulated in amplitude and FM in frequency), we can refer to the radiation in terms of its frequency. Below we list the names we assign to different parts electromagnetic spectrum.</p>

<p>In the table above, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = c/f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E=hf\)</span>. In the next course, Phy235, you will learn about the energy of the radiation.

Photon energies can be measured if they are greater than a few electron volts.</p>
<p>Some things to note about our derivation so far:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The solution with <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E} = E_y(x,t) \hat{j}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{B} = B_z(x,t) \hat{k}\)</span> are called "plane wave" solutions. The electric field vector is the same at every point in the entire y-z plane. <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> only varies in space in the "x-direction". Similarily, the magnetic field vector, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{B}\)</span>, only varies in space in the "x-direction".</p></li>
<li><p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}(x,t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{B}(x,t)\)</span> are coupled. There is no solution for electromagnetic radiation that only has an electric field vector, nor only a magnetic field vector. To have a solution <span class="math inline">\(E_y(x,t)\)</span>, one also needs <span class="math inline">\(B_z(x,t)\)</span>. The coupling is perpendicular. That is, a time changing <span class="math inline">\(E_y\)</span> produces a magnetic field in the z-direction. A time changing <span class="math inline">\(B_z\)</span> produces an electric field in the y-direction. The choice of the y-axis for <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> was arbitrary. Whatever direction we would have chosen for <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span>, both the radiation direction and the coupled <span class="math inline">\(\vec{B}\)</span> field would have been perpendicular to <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Both <span class="math inline">\(E_y(x,t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_z(x,t)\)</span> must have the same space and time variation. That is if <span class="math inline">\(E_y(x,t) = E_0 g(x \pm ct)\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(B_z(x,t) = B_0 g(x \pm ct)\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(E_y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_z\)</span> are coupled, <span class="math inline">\(E_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_0\)</span> are related to each other. To find the relationship, we carry out the derivatives:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
 {{dE_y} \over {dx}} &amp; = &amp; - {{d B_z} \over {dt}} \\
     E_0 g&#39; &amp; = &amp; -B_0 (\pm c) g&#39; \\
     E_0 &amp; = &amp; \mp c B_0 \\\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>by the chain rule. So the maximum value of the electric field <span class="math inline">\(E_y\)</span> equals <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> times the maximum value of <span class="math inline">\(B_z\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Electromagnetic radiation usually varies sinusoidally in time and space. So a common form for <span class="math inline">\(g(x \pm ct)\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  E_y &amp; = &amp; E_0 sin(kx \pm \omega t) \\
  B_z &amp; = &amp; B_0 sin(kx \pm \omega t)\\\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(k=2 \pi / \lambda\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\omega = 2 \pi f\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(E_0 = c B_0\)</span>. Here <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the frequency of the radiation.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that for "<span class="math inline">\((kx- \omega t)\)</span>" the radiation travels in the +x direction and <span class="math inline">\(B_z = + E_y/c\)</span>. For "<span class="math inline">\((kx + \omega t)\)</span>" the radiation travels in the -x direction and <span class="math inline">\(B_z = - E_y\)</span>. Thus the direction of the radiation is always in the <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E} \times \vec{B}\)</span> direction.</p></li>
<li><p>Experimental evidence for electromagnetic radiation was performed by Hertz in 1887. He produced the radiation by opening and closing a circuit with a large coil. He detected the radiation using another coil with a gap. He was able to verify many of the properties of the radiation predicted by Maxwell’s equations.</p></li>
<li><p>As we showed in our last course (Phy133), if we choose a different unit for charge, both <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span> each change, but the product <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0 \mu_0\)</span> does not. The product <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0 \mu_0\)</span> has units of <span class="math inline">\(time^2/length^2\)</span>, and is independent of our choice of units for charge.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We now consider the energy and momentum properties of the electromagnetic radiation, and its polarization.</p>
<p>Using the classical picture of electromagnetic radiation, we can find an expression for the energy density of the radiation. Last quarter we showed that the energy density of the electric field is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[U_E = {{\epsilon_0 E^2} \over 2}\]</span></p>
<p>We also showed that the energy density of the magnetic field is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[U_B = {B^2 \over {2 \mu_0}}\]</span></p>
<p>So the complete energy density of electromagnetic radiation is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  U &amp; = &amp; U_E + U_B  \\
    &amp; = &amp; {{\epsilon_0 E^2} \over 2} + {B^2 \over {2 \mu_0}}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(|B| = |E|/c\)</span>, we can combine the two terms. For the rest of the discussion, lets take the radiation to have sinusoidal space and time dependence, which is the best basis to work in. That is, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E} = E_0 sin(kx-\omega t) \hat{j}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{B} = B_0 sin(kx-\omega t) \hat{z}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(B_0 = E_0/c\)</span>. In this case</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  U(t) &amp; = &amp; ({{\epsilon_0 E_0^2} \over 2} + {B_0^2 \over {2 \mu_0}}) sin^2(kx-\omega t)\\
  U(t) &amp; = &amp; ({{\epsilon_0 E_0^2} \over 2} + {E_0^2 \over {2 \mu_0 c^2}}) sin^2(kx-\omega t)\\
       &amp; = &amp; \epsilon_0 E_0^2 sin^2(kx-\omega t)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where we have used <span class="math inline">\(c^2 = 1/(\epsilon_0 \mu_0)\)</span>. As we can see, the energy density of the electromagnetic field varies sinusoidally in space and time. It is most convenient to consider the average energy density. That is, the energy density averaged over time for a fixed location in space. We showed before that the average of <span class="math inline">\(sin^2(\omega t + \theta)\)</span> over one complete cycle is <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>. Therefore, the time averaged energy density is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[U_{ave} = {{\epsilon_0 E_0^2} \over 2}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(U_{ave}\)</span> is usually expressed in terms of <span class="math inline">\(E_0\)</span>, but we could also have expressed <span class="math inline">\(U_{ave}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(U_{ave}= B_0^2/(2 \mu_0)\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(U_E\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0 E_0^2/2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(U_B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B_0^2/(2 \mu_0)\)</span> <span><em>have the the same magnitude</em></span> since <span class="math inline">\(B_0^2=E_0^2/c^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c^2=1/(\epsilon_0 \mu_0)\)</span>.</p>
<p>A useful quantity to consider is the energy of the EM radiation per area per unit time. This quantity is refered to as the intensity of the radiation. Since the radiation travels at the speed <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, the energy passing through an area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> in a time <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[energy = U A (c \Delta t)\]</span></p>
<p>since <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is the energy per volume and a volume of <span class="math inline">\(A(c \Delta t)\)</span> passes through the area in a time <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span>. So,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  I &amp; = &amp; {{energy} \over {A (\Delta t)}} \\
    &amp; = &amp; cU \\ 
    &amp; = &amp; c \epsilon_0 E_0^2 sin^2(kx-\omega t)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>We can express the expression for <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> in terms of the magnetic field</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  I &amp; = &amp; c \epsilon_0 E_0 (cB_0) sin^2(kx-\omega t) \\
    &amp; = &amp; c^2 \epsilon_0 E_0 B_0 sin^2(kx- \omega t) \\
    &amp; = &amp; {{E_0B_0} \over \mu_0} sin^2(kx - \omega t) \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Since the wave travels in a direction perpendicular to both <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{B}\)</span> we can define an "intensity vector" with a magnitude of <span class="math inline">\(I = EB/\mu_0\)</span> in the direction of the radiation as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{S} \equiv {1 \over \mu_0} \vec{E} \times \vec{B}\]</span></p>
<p>This vector was first investigated by Poynting, and is called "Poynting’s Vector". Its magnitude equals the energy/area/time (intensity), and it poynts in the direction of the energy flow.</p>
<p><img src="fig2341c.png" style="width:14cm" alt="image" /></p>
<p>The Poynting vector equals the electromagnetic energy that is transported per area, per time. Although we showed this property here for electromagnetic radiation, it can be shown to be always valid. In your next EM course, Phy314, you will show, using vector calculus that the rate at which electromagnetic work <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is done within a volume equals the Poynting vector integrated around the surface.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{dW} \over {dt}} = \int \vec{E} \cdot \vec{J} dV = -{d \over {dt}} 
         \int {1 \over 2}(\epsilon_0E^2+B^2/\mu_0)dV - 
         \oint {{\vec{E} \times \vec{B}} \over \mu_0} \cdot \vec{dA}\]</span></p>
<p>We leave this proof for your next course on electromagnetism, but mention it here so you will appreciate the significance of Poynting’s Vector. We will do examples in class.</p>
<p>A distinguishing feature derived from Maxwell’s equations is that <span><em>the energy of electromagnetic radiation (i.e. intensity) is proportional to the electric field squared, <span class="math inline">\(E^2\)</span></em></span>. That is, brighter light will have a larger electric field. The same relationship between wave amplitude and energy is true for sound waves, water waves, and waves in general that have a medium, i.e. mechanical waves. As you will see next quarter, the photoelectric effect cannot be understood from the classical model of electromagnetic radiation presented here.</p>
<p>In the solution we just derived for electromagnetic radiation, we chose the electric field to point in the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{j}\)</span> direction. If we would have chosen <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> to point in the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{k}\)</span> direction, then <span class="math inline">\(\vec{B}\)</span> would have been in the <span class="math inline">\(-\hat{j}\)</span> direction and the wave would still have propagated in the +x-direction. The direction of propagation of the radiation is in the <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E} \times \vec{B}\)</span> direction. So, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> can point anywhere in the y-z plane and the radiation can still travel in the +x direction.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> points in either the <span class="math inline">\(+\hat{j}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(-\hat{j}\)</span> direction, the radiation is said to be linearly polarized in the "y-direction". If <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> points in either the <span class="math inline">\(+\hat{z}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(-\hat{z}\)</span> direction, the radiation is said to be linearly polarized in the "z-direction". Any superposition of these two solutions is also linearly polarized in the direction of the <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span> field. There are two linear polarization states for electromagnetic radiation. For example, for radiation that propagates in the <span class="math inline">\(+x\)</span> direction, and is linearly polarized at an angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> with respect to the y-axis, the electric field is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{E}(x,t) = E_0 (cos(\theta ) \hat{j} + sin(\theta )\hat{k}) sin(kx-\omega t)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(E_0\)</span> is the magnitude of the electric field. The corresponding magnetic field is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{B}(x,t) = B_0 (cos(\theta ) \hat{k} - sin(\theta )\hat{j}) sin(kx-\omega t)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(B_0 = E_0/c\)</span>. Another interesting combination of the two polarization states is the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{E}(x,t) = E_0 \hat{j} cos(kx-\omega t ) + E_0 \hat{k} sin(kx-\omega t)\]</span></p>
<p>with corresponding magnetic field</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{B}(x,t) = B_0 \hat{k} cos(kx-\omega t ) - B_0 \hat{j} sin(kx-\omega t)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(B_0 = E_0/c\)</span>. For this combination, the electric field vector rotates (via the right hand) in space and time. This type of polarization is termed right-handed "circularly polarized" radiation. For left-handed circularly polarized light, the electric field and magnetic fields are</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
 \vec{E}(x,t) &amp; = &amp; E_0 \hat{j} cos(kx-\omega t ) - E_0 \hat{k} sin(kx-\omega t) \\
 \vec{B}(x,t) &amp; = &amp; B_0 \hat{k} cos(kx-\omega t ) + B_0 \hat{j} sin(kx-\omega t)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>One could also have eliptically polarized radiation. There are two independent polarization states for electromagnetic radiation. One can express the polarization in terms of two linearly polarization states, in terms of two circularly polarization states, or in terms of any two independent basis states.</p>
<p>Light from an incandescent source, i.e. light bulb, has equal amount of both polarizations, and is "unpolarized". There exist polaroids that allow only one type of polarization state pass through. A linear polaroid will have a polarization axis. Radiation that is polarized along the polarization axis will pass through, and radiation that is polarized perpendicular to the polarization axis will not. If unpolarized radiation "hits" a linear polaroid, then the intensity is reduced by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>. The polarization of the transmitted radiation will be along the axis of the polaroid.</p>
<p>Consider linearly polarized radiation that "hits" a linear polaroid. Let <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> be the angle between the direction of the polarization of the radiation and the axis of the polaroid. Then, the electric field that passes through the polaroid will be reduced by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(\cos(\theta )\)</span> after passing through the polaroid. The intensity of the radiation will be decreased by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(cos^2(\theta )\)</span>. The polarization of the transmitted radiation will be along the axis of the polaroid. We will do some nice examples in lecture with polaroids.</p>
<p>This concludes the first third of our course. In the next third we will continue with our investigation of electromagnetic radiation, in particular light. The main topics will be geometric and physical optics.</p>
