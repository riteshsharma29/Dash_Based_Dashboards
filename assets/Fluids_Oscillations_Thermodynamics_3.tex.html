<p><span><strong>Notes on Thermodynamics</strong></span></p>
</div>
<p>The topic for the last part of our physics class this quarter will be thermodynamics. Thermodynamics deals with energy transfer processes. <span><strong>The key idea is that materials have "internal energy"</strong></span>. The internal energy is the energy that the atoms and molecules of the material possess. For example, in a gas and liquid the molecules are moving and have kinetic energy. The molecules can also rotate and vibrate, and these motions also contribute to the gases total internal energy. In a solid, the atoms can oscillate about their equilibrium position and also possess energy. The total internal energy is defined as:<br />
<br />
When two substances come in contact, internal energy from one substance can decrease while the internal energy of the other increases. The first law of thermodynamics states that the energy lost by one substance is gained by the other. That is, that there exists a quantity called energy that is conserved. We will develop this idea and more over the next 4 weeks.</p>
<p>We will be analyzing gases, liquids, and solids, so we need to determine which properties are necessary for an appropriate description of these materials. Although we will be making models about the constituents of these materials, what is usually measured are their <span><strong>macroscopic quantities</strong></span> or "large scale" properties of the systems. We have already some of these when we studied fluids in the beginning of the course:<br />
(<span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>): The volume that the material occupies. Volume is a scalar.<br />
(<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>): The pressure equals the force/area if a surface is placed in the liquid or gas. Pressure is also a scalar.<br />
Both these quantities are <span><strong>state variables</strong></span>. State variables are quantities (macroscopic) that only depend on the state of the system and not on how the system was formed. The systems total internal energy (<span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>) defined above is also a state variable. We will be interested in the relationships between the state variables of a system. One of the most important concepts in thermodynamics is that of temperature. Our first task will be to determine a consistent way to quantify it, that is find a way to measure it and assign a number value to the temperature of a system.</p>
<p><strong>Temperature and Thermometers</strong></p>
<p>We have a general idea of what temperature is: hot things have a higher temperature than colder ones. However, Physics is an exact quantitative science, so we need to be precise with temperature. In order for a system to have a unique temperature it needs to be in thermal equilibrium.<br />
: A system is in thermal equilibrium if the macroscopic state variables do not change in time.<br />
Before we can assign a number value to the temperature we need to have a qualitative understanding of what temperature is. Temperature is some sort of measure of which way energy will be transfered when two systems are in contact. Energy will flow from a system that has a higher temperature to one that has a lower one. For two systems to have the same temperature, it means that when they are placed in contact there will not be any energy transfer from one to the other. That is, when they are placed in contact with each other, the macroscopic quantities stay the same, i.e. they are in thermal equilibrium. The "Zeroth law" of thermodynamics includes a third system:<br />
: If system A and system B are in thermal equilibrium with system C (i.e. they have the same temperature as C), they they are in thermal equilibrium with each other (i.e. they have the same temperature).<br />
This property of nature enables one to assign a number value to temperature. We just need to choose two reference values, and use a substance with a macroscopic quantity that varies with "our preception of temperature". The substance we call a thermometer.</p>
<p>The Celsius choice of reference values is to assign the triple point of water (where <span class="math inline">\(H_2O\)</span> exists in solid, liquid and vapor forms) to be zero degrees. The other reference value is assigned to be 100 degrees where water and steam co-exist at one atmosphere pressure. Suppose we have a third substance at an unknown temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. How do we determine <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>? One way is to pick a substance to be a thermometer and define <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> to be proportional to a macroscopic quantity of the substance. Let’s demonstrate this with an example.</p>
<p>We will find the value of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> of an object using three different substances for thermometers: liquid mercury, a resistor and a dilute gas. As our parameter we will choose the volume of mercury, the resistance of the resistor and the pressure of the dilute gas. Here is our (made-up) data:</p>

</div>
<p>The "unknown" temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> of the object is determined for each thermometer by having the temperature be proportional to the parameter that is changing. So using the mercury thermometer,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T = 100 ({{6.5 - 4.0} \over {8.0 - 4.0}}) = 62.5^\circ\]</span></p>
<p>Using the resistance thermometer,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T = 100 ({{3.24 - 3.0} \over {3.4 - 3.0}}) = 60.0^\circ\]</span></p>
<p>Using the dilute gas thermometer,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T = 100 ({{1.23 - 1.0} \over {1.37 - 1.0}}) = 62.2^\circ\]</span></p>
<p>The data was "made-up", however if real data were used the results would be similar: in general the temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> can depend on the type of thermometer used. This is because temperature is defined to make the parameter of the thermometer proportional to <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. All thermometers will agree at the two reference temperatures. However, in general, the parameters for each thermometer do not have exactly the same behavior between the reference points.</p>
<p>You might ask, which substance is the best to use as a thermometer? Is it possible to define temperature such that the equations of thermodynamics have a simple form for all substances? It would be nice if there were a class of substances that all give the same value for <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. There is. After trying different types of thermometers we would discover the following property about the dilute gas thermometer above: we get the same value for <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> for any gas that we use! That is, if we use air, or <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(O_2\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(He\)</span>, etc. the value of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> for our object, obtained by measuring the pressure of the gas, would be the same in each case. There are many proerties that all dilute gases have in common. Thus, if we quantify temperature using the constant volume dilute gas thermometer, there is a good chance that this method gives a useful definition of temperature. This will be our first way to quantify temperature.</p>
<p>You might be thinking: How small should the density of the gas be for it to be delute enough? The common properties converge only in the limit as the density of the gas goes to zero. We define an <span><strong>ideal gas</strong></span>:<br />
: The limit as the density of the gas approaches zero of a dilute gas.<br />
We will call the thermometer a constant volume "ideal gas thermometer", and the parameter is the pressure of the gas. Using the references of the Celsius scale, we find that the pressure of the gas would be zero at around <span class="math inline">\(-273^\circ\)</span>C. It will be useful to choose the value of temperature when the pressure of an ideal gas is zero to be zero degrees. With this choice we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T \propto P\]</span></p>
<p>So temperature is defined to be proportional to the pressure of an ideal gas. The constant of proportionality is chosen such that the change of one degree is the same as the change of one degree Celsius. That is, the difference in temperature between boiling water and the triple point is <span class="math inline">\(100^\circ\)</span>. For this choice, the proportionality constant becomes <span class="math inline">\(273.16^\circ\)</span> at the triple point of water.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T \equiv  {P \over {P_{tp}}} 273.16\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(P_{tp}\)</span> is the pressure of the gas at the triple point of water. It is important to note that <span><strong>both pressures must be measured at the same volume of the gas</strong></span> (Constant Volume Thermometer). The unit of this definition of temperature is the Kelvin (<span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>). To measure temperature in the lab or in our homes we can’t carry around a dilute gas and water at the triple point. Commercial thermometer are calibrated against this standard thermometer and have a range of validity.</p>
<p>Are the units of temperature derivable from other fundamental units such as length, time, mass, ...? Or is temperature a fundamental physical quantity? Later in the course we will consider these questions and discuss better ways to define temperature that do not require a thermometer substance at all. One way uses a "Carnot cycle" and the other way is a statistical approach developed by Boltzmann. However, the ideal gas thermometer gives the same value for <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> as these other approaches. Until we develop the physics behind these other approaches, we will define temperature via the ideal-gas constant-volume thermometer.</p>
<p><strong>Thermal Expansion</strong></p>
<p>When the internal energy of a substance increases, the atoms and molecules gain energy, tend to vibrate with larger amplitudes and the substance usually increases in size. In addition to increasing in size, an increase in internal energy usually is accompanied by an increase in temperature. To a good approximation the fractional increase in size is proportional to the change in temperature.</p>
<p>Consider first a long rod made of a solid material. As long as the change in temperature, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T\)</span>, is not too large, the fractional change in length is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{\Delta L} \over {L_0}} \; is \; proportional \; to \; \Delta T\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(L_0\)</span> is the original length before the increase in temperature. The proportionality constant for <span><strong>linear expansion</strong></span> is usually called <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{\Delta L} \over {L_0}} = \alpha \Delta T\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> depends on the type of material. If we call <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> the final length of the rod after the increase in temperature, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{L - L_0} \over {L_0}} = \alpha \Delta T\]</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[L = L_0 (1 +  \alpha \Delta T)\]</span></p>
<p>A rectangular object will expand in the same fractional way. If the original sides of the rectangle are <span class="math inline">\(a_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span>, then after a temperature increase of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T\)</span>, side <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> will increase to <span class="math inline">\(a_0 (1 + \alpha \Delta T)\)</span> and side <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> will increase to <span class="math inline">\(b_0 (1 + \alpha \Delta T)\)</span>. The new area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> will be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A = ab = a_0 (1 + \alpha \Delta T) b_0 (1 + \alpha \Delta T)\]</span></p>
<p>multiplying out the terms gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A = a_0 b_0 (1 + 2 \alpha \Delta T + (\alpha \Delta T)^2)\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \Delta T\)</span> is small, the last term is on the right is much smaller than the middle term, so to a good approximation we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A \approx a_0 b_0 (1 + 2 \alpha \Delta T)\]</span></p>
<p>Since the original area <span class="math inline">\(A_0 = a_0 b_0\)</span>, the equation for "area" expansion is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A \approx A_0 (1 + 2 \alpha \Delta T)\]</span></p>
<p>Using similar reasoning, one obtains the <span><strong>volume expansion</strong></span> formula</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V \approx V_0 (1 + 3 \alpha \Delta T)\]</span></p>
<p>These formulas are not fundamental laws of nature, but rather empirical results and have a limited range of validity. If the temperature keeps increasing, the solid does not keep getting bigger and bigger, but eventually melts.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Transfer Processes</strong></p>
<p>The study of energy transfer processes assumes that all "systems" possess "internal energy". By internal energy we mean the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the consitituents of the "system". In this course we will consider systems that are bulk materials like gases, liquids, and solids. One can extend these ideas to smaller systems like molecules, atoms or nuclei. Exeriments verify that objects are made up of atoms and molecules and contain internal energy.</p>
<p>The constituents of a system can gain energy or lose energy, and consequently the total interal energy of a system can change. <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is denoted as the total internal energy, and<br />
<br />
<span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> can change in different ways, but we divide the possibilities into two catagories: those due to mechanical work and those only due a temperature difference:<br />
<br />
Note the preposition <span><strong>by</strong></span> in the defination of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. <span><strong>If <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is positive then the system loses internal energy</strong></span>, since the system is doing work. <span><strong>If <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is negative then the system gains internal energy</strong></span>, since work is done on the system. This is the convention chosen by scientists. It will make sense when we use a <span class="math inline">\(P-V\)</span> diagram.<br />
<br />
Note that <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is the energy transfered <span><strong>to</strong></span> the system, so if <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is positive then so is <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is also defined as energy that is transfered as a result of a temperature difference only. <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is also called heat. Heat is a transfer of energy.</p>
<p>Both <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> have units of energy. The metric unit of energy is the Joule. However, experiments with heat processes were done before it was realized that heat processes could be related to mechanical energy. The unit of the Calorie was used. The conversion from calorie to the Joule, the mechanical equivalent of heat, is <span class="math inline">\(4.186\)</span> Joules = <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> calorie. The "calorie" listed on food packages is equal to <span class="math inline">\(1000\)</span> calories or <span class="math inline">\(4186\)</span> Joules.</p>
<p>In general both types of processes can occur at the same time, so the change in <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is the sum of these two energy transfer processes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta U = Q - W\]</span></p>
<p>The minus sign on <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is due to the definition of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> as the work done by the system. This equation is called <span><strong>the first law of thermodynamics</strong></span>. It is a statement recognizing the existence of internal energy and its conservation.</p>
<p>When a system gains (or loses) internal energy, the temperature of the system usually changes. It is interesting to measure how much the temperature changes for a certain amount of internal energy change. Here we consider how much the temperature changes due to heat processes.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a particular substance, whose mass is <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. If we transfer an amount of energy <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> into the substance, keeping its volume constant, the temperature of the substance will in general change. Call the change in temperature <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T\)</span>. How is <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> related to <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T\)</span>? If <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is doubled, we will need twice the amount of energy transfered (<span class="math inline">\(2Q\)</span>). This is true, since doubling the mass is the same has having two identical samples. Twice the energy is needed. So for the same <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Q \propto m\)</span>. Also, if <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T\)</span> is not too large, if we want twice the temperature change, we will need twice the energy transfer. So for a fixed mass, <span class="math inline">\(Q \propto \Delta T\)</span>. Combining these two proportions gives:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q \propto m \Delta T\]</span></p>
<p>We can make this an equal sign by adding a constant of proportionality:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q = c_v m \Delta T\]</span></p>
<p>The parameter <span class="math inline">\(c_v\)</span> is called the <span><strong>specific heat capacity</strong></span> for the process in which the volume is held constant. Note that this is not a new fundamental law of nature, but rather a phenomenological equation. <span class="math inline">\(c_v\)</span> will depend on the type of substance and can also depend on temperature. If <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T\)</span> is so large that <span class="math inline">\(c_v\)</span> changes with <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, then one has to integrate:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q = \int_{T_i}^{T_f} c_v(T)  m \; dT\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_f\)</span> are the initial and final temperatures respectively. An important feature of specific heat capacities is that they are measureable quantities. The challenge we have as a physicist is to understand <span class="math inline">\(c_v\)</span> from the microscopic structure of the substance. In this course we will do this for gases.</p>
<p>If the heat capacity of a substance is large, it means that it takes a lot of energy transfer to increase the temperature a little. Likewise, if a substance has a high heat capacity, it has to lose a lot of internal energy for a small temperature change. It stays "hot" for a long time. The cheese on a pizza has a higher heat capacity than the bread crust.</p>
<p>Latent heat is the amount of energy transfer (per mass) that is needed to change the phase of a substance. For example, if you heat up water on the stove the temperature rises until it reaches <span class="math inline">\(100^\circ\)</span>C. As more energy is transfered to the water the temperature does not increase any more. Rather, the water evaporates and changes its state from liquid to vapor. The amount of energy transfer that is required for this phase change (per unit mass) is called the latent heat. Tt takes twice the amount of energy to change the phase of twice the mass. So, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q = m L\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is the amount of energy tranfered (heat) to change the phase of a substance of mass <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. The proportionality constant <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is called the <span><strong>latent heat</strong></span> and has units of Joules/Kg, or cal/g. If the phase change is from solid to liquid (or liquid to solid) <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is called the latent heat of fusion. If the phase change is from liquid to vapor (or vapor to liquid) <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is called the latent heat of vaporization.</p>
<p>I have included a nice schematic of the energy transfers involved for water at one atmosphere as it gains or loses energy. See the attached figure. The three different states of water go from left to right, and the temperature goes up and down. Similar schematics can be drawn for other substances.</p>
<p><img src="fig1323a.png" style="width:14cm" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Before we carry out a microscopic analysis of a dilute gas, we mention one relationship that pertains to (one dimensional) thermal conduction. Consider a rod of length <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> and area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Let the left end be in contact with a large object that is at a temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_A\)</span>. Let the right end be in contact with a large object that is at a temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_B\)</span>. What is the rate <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> at which energy is transfered through the rod? The units of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> are energy/time. What does <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> depend on?<br />
Area: The larger the area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, the faster energy can be transfered, so <span class="math inline">\(H \propto A\)</span>.<br />
Length: The longer the length <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> that the rod is, the slower is the energy transfer, so we will guess that <span class="math inline">\(H \propto 1/l\)</span>.<br />
Temperature difference: The larger that <span class="math inline">\(T_A - T_B\)</span> is, the faster the energy will be transfered, so <span class="math inline">\(H \propto (T_A - T_B)\)</span>.<br />
Putting these ideas together we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H \propto {{(T_A - T_B) A} \over l}\]</span></p>
<p>Changing the proportionality by an equal sign brings in a constant <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H = k {{(T_A - T_B) A} \over l}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is called the thermal conductivity.</p>
<p>It is interesting to include both the properties of heat capacity and thermal conductivity in one application. Suppose the object at the left end of the rod has a mass <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and a specific heat capacity of <span class="math inline">\(c_v\)</span>. Let the temperature on the right, <span class="math inline">\(T_B\)</span>, be held constant, but let the temperature of the object on the left decrease as it loses energy. Let <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> be the temperature of the object on the left at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Then we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H =  k {{(T - T_B) A} \over l}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is the energy loss per second of the left object. The amount of energy, <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, the object loses in a time <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q = H \Delta t  = k {{(T - T_B) A} \over l} \Delta t\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(Q = m c_v \Delta T\)</span>, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[m c_v {{\Delta T} \over {\Delta t}} = - k {{(T - T_B) A} \over l}\]</span></p>
<p>Taking the limit as <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> goes to zero results in a simple differential equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{d T} \over {d t}} = - k {{(T - T_B) A} \over {m c_v l}}\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(T_B\)</span> is a constant, <span class="math inline">\(dT/dt=d(T-T_B)/dt\)</span>. If we define the temperature difference between the left and right sides, <span class="math inline">\((T - T_B)\)</span>, as <span class="math inline">\(\delta T\)</span>, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{d (\delta T)} \over {d t}} = -  {{k A} \over {m c_v l}} (\delta T)\]</span></p>
<p>This is a simple differential equation whose solution is an exponentially decaying function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\delta T = (\delta T)_0 e^{- {{kA} \over {m c_v l}} t}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\((\delta T_0\)</span> is the initial temperature difference between the left and right side. Thus the temperature decreases exponentially to its final value. This type of cooling is called Newton’s cooling.</p>
<p>: Energy transfered by a movement of mass is called convection. Some demonstrations of convection will be presented in class, but we will not do a quantitative analysis of convection.</p>
<p>Energy can also be tranfered through a vacuum (as well as air). Objects naturally "radiate" electro-magnetic energy. The electro-magnetic interaction will be covered next quarter. Here we present the formula, without derivation, of the amount of electro-magnetic energy radiated from an object at a temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P = \sigma A e T^4\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is the energy/sec (power) radiated, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the area of the object, <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is the emissivity, and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the temperature in <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is a constant, the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and is equal to <span class="math inline">\(5.669 \times 10^{-8}\)</span> K<span class="math inline">\(^4\)</span> W/m<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>. The emissivity depends on the properties of the object and takes values between zero and one.</p>
<p><strong>Ideal Gases</strong></p>
<p><strong>Experiments on an Ideal Gas</strong></p>
<p>Our discussion so far has been phenominological. That is, we have been finding empirical formulas that relate (and define) certain quantities. Now we would like to do some physics. We would like to understand the relationships between macroscopic quantities from a microscopic model of the substance. In physics we usually start with the simplest systems first, then extend our ideas to more complicated situations. Due to the universality of ideal gases in defining temperature, we suspect that an ideal gas might be a system for which a simple model will explain many properties. For the rest of the course we will mainly analyze ideal gases and see what they can teach us about energy transfer processes.</p>
<p>Let’s first summarize the experimental data on ideal gases. Remember an ideal gas is a dilute gas in the limit that the density approaches zero. Think of an ideal gas as a very dilute gas. The main macroscopic measureable quantities that describe an ideal gas are:<br />
(V): the volume of the container that confines the gas.<br />
(P): The pressure in the gas. If the gas is in equilibrium then the pressure is the same everywhere (neglecting gravity).<br />
(T): We have used ideal gases to define temperature. If the gas is in equilibrium, the temperature is the same everywhere.<br />
(N): The mass of a gas can be measured, and we assume that <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, the number of molecules, is proportional to its mass. We will use the parameter <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, although difficult to measure, could be determined using Avogadro’s number.<br />
How are these four quantities related to each other. We need to keep two fixed and experimentally determine how the other two depend on each other.<br />
<br />
How does <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> depend on <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>? We defined temperature to be proportional to <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, so</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T \propto P\]</span></p>
<p>Although we defined <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> so this proportionality is true, the fact that we get the same value for <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> no matter what the gas is something special. It is a nice experimental result.<br />
<br />
How does <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> depend on <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>? If the volume of a gas is increases with constant temperature, the pressure is reduced. We will show in lecture that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P \propto {1 \over V}\]</span></p>
<p>This is a really nice and simple experimental result! Why is it so simple? What can we learn from this relationship?<br />
<br />
How does <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> depend on <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>? We will show in lecture that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P \propto N\]</span></p>
<p>We can combine the results of these three experiments into one equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P \propto {{NT} \over V}\]</span></p>
<p><br />
How does <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> depend on <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> in this case? From the above equation we must have <span class="math inline">\(V \propto T\)</span>, which is verified experimentally.<br />
We can replace the proportionality sign with an equal sign by adding a proportionality constant:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P = {{NkT} \over V}\]</span></p>
<p>where the constant <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is called Boltzmann’s constant. We will discuss its value later. This equation is also written in terms of the number of moles of the gas by multiplying and dividing by Avogadro’s number, <span class="math inline">\(N_A\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    Nk &amp; = &amp; ({N \over N_A})(N_A k)\\
       &amp; = &amp; n R\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of moles of the gas, and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is called the gas constant. Note that <span class="math inline">\(R = N_A k\)</span>. The <span><strong>equation of state for an ideal gas</strong></span> is often written as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[PV = nRT\]</span></p>
<p>The constant <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is measureable, once we have decided on how much mass a mole is and our temperature scale (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T\)</span> between boiling water and the triple point). We need to measure the pressure, volume and Temperature for a known number of moles. The resuls is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R \approx 8.34 {{Joules} \over {mole \; ^\circ K}}\]</span></p>
<p>Once Avagadro’s number is known to be <span class="math inline">\(6.02 \times 10^{23}\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \; J/^\circ K\)</span>.</p>
<p>Our task now is to come up with a microscopic model to explain this equation of state. There are other experimental quantites to compare with, <span class="math inline">\(c_v\)</span> being one of them. First, we will try to understand the equation of state.</p>
<p><strong>Kinetic Theory: A model for ideal gases</strong></p>
<p>Consider a dilute gas that is contained in a box with sides of equal length <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. Our model of a gas is that it consists of a large number <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> of molecules that are "bouncing around" inside the container. We will assume that the molecules bounce off each other and the sides of the container elastically. That is, the molecules do not lose kinetic energy in the collisions. We will also neglect the gravitational potential energy of the molecules, <span class="math inline">\(mgy\)</span>. This will be OK if the kinetic energy of each molecule is much larger than <span class="math inline">\(mgL\)</span>. As we will see, this is a good approximation.</p>
<p>Pressure is force/area. How are the molecules applying a force to the sides? By bouncing off, their momentum is changed. Force is change in momentum per time. Let’s determine the change in momentum of a molecule as it bounces off a side of the box, a side in the y-z plane.<br />
. <span><strong>Momentum Change per bounce</strong></span>: Momentum is <span class="math inline">\(m \vec{v}\)</span>. When a molecule bounces <span><em>elastically</em></span> off a side (in the y-z plane), the x-component of its velocity gets reversed. The x-component of its momentum changes from <span class="math inline">\(m v_x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(-m v_x\)</span>. This is a <span><em>net change</em></span> of<br />
</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(2 m v_x\)</span></p>
<p>. <span><strong>Force of one molecule on side</strong></span>: The force the side feels from this one molecule will be: (the number of times the molecule hits the side per second) times <span class="math inline">\(2m v_x\)</span>, since force is (momentum change)/time. The number of times the molecule hits the side per second is <span class="math inline">\(v_x/(2L)\)</span>. So the force of one molecule on the side is: <span class="math inline">\((2m v_x)(v_x/(2L)\)</span> or<br />
</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(m v_x^2/L\)</span></p>
<p>. <span><strong>Average Pressure one molecule exerts on one side</strong></span>: Since pressure is force/area, the pressure is just <span class="math inline">\((m v_x^2/L)/L^2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(m v_x^2/L^3\)</span>. As the molecules bounce off each other they will have collisions at different angles and their speeds will change. At any time the speeds of the molecules in a gas will have a range of values. To find the average pressure, we should take the average value of <span class="math inline">\(v_x^2\)</span> which we write as <span class="math inline">\(\bar{v_x^2}\)</span>. So the average pressure that one molecule exerts on a side (in the y-z plane) is<br />
<span class="math display">\[{{m \bar{v_x^2}} \over L^3}\]</span></p>
<p>. <span><strong>Average Pressure for N molecules</strong></span>: If there are <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> molecules in the gas, then the average pressure on a side is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P = {{N m \bar{v_x^2}} \over L^3}\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly, the average pressure on a side in the x-y plane is <span class="math inline">\(P = N m \bar{v_z^2}/L^3\)</span> and on a side in the x-z plane is <span class="math inline">\(P=N m \bar{v_y^2}/L^3\)</span>. If a molecule is equally likely to move in any direction, then <span class="math inline">\(\bar{v_x^2} =
\bar{v_y^2} = \bar{v_z^2}\)</span>. Since the magnitude of the velocity is <span class="math inline">\(v^2 = v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(\bar{v_x^2} = \bar{v^2}/3\)</span>. Substituting this into the equation above we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P = {{N m \bar{v^2}} \over {3 L^3}}\]</span></p>
<p>However, <span class="math inline">\(V = L^3\)</span>, so the equation can be written</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P = {N \over V}({{m \bar{v^2}} \over 3})\]</span></p>
<p>Wow, the model is consistent with the data. The equation states that pressure is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and inversely proportional to <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> as demonstrated by experiment. The terms on the right side deserve some comment.<br />
? Pressure is Force/Area, and Area goes as <span class="math inline">\(L^2\)</span>. The other factor of <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> in the denominator is because the larger <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is, the molecules will have fewer collisions/sec with the sides. Hence, the pressure is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(1/L^2\)</span> times <span class="math inline">\(1/L\)</span>.<br />
?: One power of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is because momentum is proportional to velocity. The other power of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is because the faster the molecule travels the more often it will hit the side. Hence, pressure is proportional to the average of <span class="math inline">\(v^2\)</span>.<br />
? The pressure is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> because the number of collisions with the wall per sec is proportional to the number of molecules in the container.<br />
In addition to understanding the data, the above equation gives us an expression relating temperature and the average kinetic energy of a molecule in the gas. The Kinetic Theory gives <span class="math inline">\((PV/N) = m \bar{v^2} /3\)</span>, and experiment yields <span class="math inline">\((PV/N) = kT\)</span>. Equating the right sides of these equations gives:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[kT = {{m \bar{v^2}} \over 3}\]</span></p>
<p>Remembering that the kinetic energy equals <span class="math inline">\(m v^2 /2\)</span>, we can write the right side in terms of the average kinetic energy of a gas molecule:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[kT = {2 \over 3} \;  \overline{K.E.}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\overline{K.E}\)</span> is the average kinetic energy of a molecule in the gas.<br />
: The temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> used in these equations was defined using an ideal-gas constant-volume thermometer. The kinetic theory model gives <span class="math inline">\(PV = (2/3) N \overline{K.E.}\)</span>. Thus, if <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is held constant then <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is proportional to the average kinetic energy of a molecule. The constant volume thermometer defines <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> proportional to <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. So, using an ideal-gas constant-volume thermometer is essentially defining temperature to be proportional to the average <span class="math inline">\(K.E.\)</span> per molecule. With this definition of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, it doesn’t matter which type of gas is used. This explains the universal nature of an ideal-gas thermometer.</p>
<p>: For the ideal gas, it is OK to think of temperature as the average kinetic energy per molecule. However, this is not true in general. We will discuss a broader concept of temperature later. Nonetheless, <span class="math inline">\(kT\)</span> has units of energy, and temperature does not require a new unit. It can always be coupled with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and hence the units of energy.<br />
: From our model, we can calculate the average speed of a gas molecule. The easiest "speed" to calculate is the root-mean-square speed or RMS speed. The RMS speed is the square-root of the average speed-squared: <span class="math inline">\(v_{rms} \equiv \sqrt{\bar{v^2}}\)</span>. From our equation above,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[v_{rms} = \sqrt{ {{3kT} \over m} } = \sqrt{ {{3RT} \over M}}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the <span><em>molar mass</em></span> of the gas. Remember <span><strong>T must be in Kelvin</strong></span>. Let’s calculate <span class="math inline">\(v_{rms}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(N_2\)</span> at room temperature of <span class="math inline">\(T = 293^\circ\)</span>K. <span class="math inline">\(v_{rms} = \sqrt{3(8.34)293/(0.028 \; kg)} \approx 510\)</span>m/s. The air molecules are hitting you with an average speed of <span class="math inline">\(510\)</span>m/s. Our assumption that the kinetic energy is much greater than <span class="math inline">\(mgL\)</span> is OK.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Energy of an Ideal Gas</strong></p>
<p>From the kinetic theory model we can obtain an expression for the total internal energy <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> of an ideal gas. The simplest form would be the sum of the kinetic energies of the molecules. If the gas contains <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> molecules:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[U = N {{m \bar{v^2}} \over 2}\]</span></p>
<p>Using <span class="math inline">\(m \bar{v^2} = 3 kT\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> can be expressed in terms of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[U = {3 \over 2} NkT = {3 \over 2} nRT\]</span></p>
<p>This is result is due to our definition of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and the properties of an ideal gas. If the number of molecules are fixed, the total energy <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> only depends on the temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Another way of writing the equation is to use <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(NkT = PV\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(U = (3/2) PV\)</span>. However, it is nicer to recognize that <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> depends on only one parameter <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.<br />
: Heat capacity relates the temperature increase to the energy transfered to the substance. For gases it is convenient to consider the <span><strong>heat capacity per mole</strong></span> of the gas. If the volume is held fixed during the process, no work is done by the gas, so <span class="math inline">\(Q = \Delta U\)</span>, so we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q = \Delta U = {3 \over 2} n R \Delta T\]</span></p>
<p>So, <span class="math inline">\(c_v = (3/2) R = 12.5\)</span> Joules/<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C per mole of the gas. The measured values of <span class="math inline">\(c_v\)</span> for the nobel gases (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(He\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Ne\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(Kr\)</span>) are very close to this value for all temperatures where the elements are gases. The measured values of <span class="math inline">\(c_v\)</span> per mole for other gases are also close to <span class="math inline">\(12.5\)</span> Joules/<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C <span><em>for low temperatures</em></span>.<br />
Since the kinetic theory explains many properties of gases, we are now ready to examine some thermodynamic processes for ideal gases. We first consider monatomic gases, since they are the simplest.</p>
<p><strong>Processes for a Monatomic Ideal Gas</strong></p>
<p>By a "process" we mean that some of the parameters of a gas (<span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, and/or <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>) are varied as the gas changes from one state to another. For most of the processes we consider, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> will not change. Many kinds of processes are possible. Here we will consider some simple ones. We will mainly analyze processes that are "reversible" or equivalently "quasi-static":<br />
: A slow or "quasi-static" process in which the system is always in equilibrium.<br />
In a process, the internal energy <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> can change. This change is due to work done <span><strong>by</strong></span> the gas <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, and energy transfered due to temperature differences <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. Processes can be graphically represented by a plot in the <span class="math inline">\(P-V\)</span> plane. The pressure <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is plotted on the vertical axis, and the volume <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is plotted on the horizontal axis. The work done by the gas is easily determined in the <span class="math inline">\(P-V\)</span> plane.<br />
<br />
Work is force times displacement. The work done <span><strong>by</strong></span> a gas is the force it exerts times the distance the force acts. However, force is pressure times area. Thus, the work done by the gas is the pressure <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> times area times the distance the area moves. Area times distance is the change in the volume of the gas, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta V\)</span>. So if the volume of a gas changes by an amount <span class="math inline">\(\Delta V\)</span>, the gas does work <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> equal to <span class="math inline">\(P \Delta V\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W_{by \; gas} = P \Delta V\]</span></p>
<p>If the pressure changes as the volume changes, then one needs to integrate <span class="math inline">\(P dV\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W_{by} = \int P dV\]</span></p>
<p>In the <span class="math inline">\(P-V\)</span> plane, <span><strong>the work is just the area under the curve</strong></span> representing the process. Using this equation for <span class="math inline">\(W_{by}\)</span>, and the relationship <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U = (3/2) n R \Delta T\)</span>, we can determine these two quantites and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> for any process involving ideal monatomic gases.<br />
: An isometric process is a process in which the <span><strong>volume is constant</strong></span>, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta V = 0\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> will change. In this case, <span class="math inline">\(W = 0\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(Q = \Delta U = (3/2) nR \Delta T\)</span>. If the initial pressure is <span class="math inline">\(P_i\)</span> and the final pressure is <span class="math inline">\(P_f\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Q = (3/2) nR(T_f - T_i) = (3/2) (P_f V - P_i V)\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(Q = (3/2) V (P_f - P_i)\)</span>. The chart below summarizes our results:</p>

<p>: An isobaric process is one in which the <span><strong>pressure is held constant</strong></span>. <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> will change. So the work done by the gas is: <span class="math inline">\(W_{by} = P \Delta V\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(W_{by} = P(V_f - V_i)\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(PV=nRT\)</span>, the work done by the gas can also be written in terms of the initial and final temperatures: <span class="math inline">\(W_{by} = nR(T_f - T_i) = nR \Delta T\)</span> for the isobaric process. The change in internal energy <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U\)</span> is determined by the change in temperature, so <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U = (3/2) nR \Delta T\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> for the isobaric process can be determined from:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta U = Q - W_{by}\]</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    Q &amp; = &amp; \Delta U + W_{by}\\
      &amp; = &amp; {3 \over 2} nR \Delta T + nR \Delta T\\
    Q  &amp; = &amp; {5 \over 2} nR \Delta T \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The factor <span class="math inline">\((5/2) nR\)</span> is a <span><strong>heat capacity for a constant pressure process</strong></span>. The heat capacity at constant pressure per mole of a monatomic gas is <span class="math inline">\(c_p = (5/2) R = 20.8\)</span>J/<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>K. Note: <span class="math inline">\(c_p &gt; c_v\)</span>. It takes more heat to raise the temperature for an isobaric process than an isometric process. This is because in an isobaric process some energy is used by the gas as it does work expanding. The experimental data for <span class="math inline">\(c_p\)</span> agree well with this value for the nobel gases at all temperatures.<br />

<p>: An isothermal process is one in which the <span><strong>temperature is held constant</strong></span>. <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> will change.

<p>Consider an isothermal process in which the volume increases from <span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(V_f\)</span>. From the ideal gas law: <span class="math inline">\(P = nRT/V\)</span>, so the pressure decreases as <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> increases if <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is constant. Since the pressure changes, to find the work done by the gas, we need to integrate:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W_{by} = \int_{V_i}^{V_f} P dV\]</span></p>

<p>: An adiabatic process is one in which <span class="math inline">\(Q=0\)</span>. In this case, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U = - W_{by}\)</span>. Suppose a gas starts out with a initial volume <span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span> and pressure <span class="math inline">\(P_i\)</span>. If the volume is then increased slowly to a value <span class="math inline">\(V &gt; V_i\)</span>, what is the pressure? Since the temperature will change in this process, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> does not equal <span class="math inline">\(V_i P_i / V\)</span>. That is, although <span class="math inline">\(PV = nRT\)</span> at any moment of the process, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is changing and so is the product <span class="math inline">\(PV\)</span>. To determine how <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> changes with <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, we start with:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta U = - W_{by} = - P \Delta V\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(U = (3/2)nRT=(3/2)PV\)</span> for a monatomic gas, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{3 \over 2} \Delta (PV) = - P \Delta V\]</span></p>
<p>Using the product rule for differentials</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{3 \over 2} (P \Delta V + V \Delta P ) = -P \Delta V\]</span></p>
<p>Rearrainging terms:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{3 \over 2} {{\Delta P} \over P} = - {5 \over 2} {{\Delta V} \over V}\]</span></p>
<p>Taking the limit at <span class="math inline">\(\Delta P \rightarrow 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta V \rightarrow 0\)</span> gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{3 \over 2} \int {{d P} \over P} = - {5 \over 2} \int {{dV} \over V}\]</span></p>
<p>After integrating, the equation becomes</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{3 \over 2} lnP + {5 \over 2} lnV = ln(P^{3/2} V^{5/2}) = Const\]</span></p>
<p>If we define the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \equiv 5/3\)</span>, then during the adiabatic process</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P V^\gamma = P_i V_i^\gamma\]</span></p>
<p>The work is found by integrating <span class="math inline">\(\int P dV\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W_{by} = \int_{V_i}^{V_f} {{P_i V_i^\gamma} \over {V^\gamma}} dV\]</span></p>
<p>which, after some algebra, is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W_{by} = {{P_i V_i} \over {\gamma - 1}} (1 - ({V_i \over V_f})^{\gamma - 1})\]</span></p>
<p>This work done by the gas will decrease the internal energy. It is interesting to calculate the change in temperature in adiabatic process. Since <span class="math inline">\(PV^\gamma = const\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_i V_i^\gamma = P_f V_f^\gamma\]</span></p>
<p>Using <span class="math inline">\(P = (nRT)/V\)</span> we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T_i V_i^{\gamma -1} = T_f V_f^{\gamma - 1}\]</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T_f = T_i ({V_i \over V_F})^{\gamma - 1}\]</span></p>
<p>For a monatomic gas, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 5/3\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\gamma - 1 = 2/3\)</span>. If the volume decreases by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, then the final temperature in Kelvin increases by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(2^{2/3} = 1.59\)</span>. A volume change by <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> gives <span class="math inline">\(5^{2/3} = 2.92\)</span>, and a ten-fold change gives <span class="math inline">\(10^{2/3} = 4.64\)</span>. The work done "on" the gas increases the internal energy. That <span><em>the temperature is correctly predicted by our model supports the hypothesis</em></span> of the first law of thermodynamics: that <span><em>mechanical work can be directly converted into internal energy</em></span>.</p>
<p>By a closed cycle process we mean a process which ends at the same state that it started. If the final state is the same as the initial state, then <span class="math inline">\(U_f = U_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U = 0\)</span> for the closed cycle. However, the work done in the closed cycle will not be zero, but rather the area enclosed by the process in the <span class="math inline">\(P-V\)</span> plane. We will demonstrate these ideas with an example, which uses specific values for the states.<br />
Our system will be <span><strong>2 moles of <span class="math inline">\(He\)</span></strong></span>, which is a monatomic gas.<br />
: Volume = <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> liters; Pressure = <span class="math inline">\(400 \times 10^3\)</span>Pa.<br />
: Volume = <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> liters; Pressure = <span class="math inline">\(200 \times 10^3\)</span>Pa.<br />
: Volume = <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> liters; Pressure = <span class="math inline">\(200 \times 10^3\)</span>Pa.<br />
Note: With this information, we can calculate the temperatures of the different states. Since <span class="math inline">\(T = (PV)/(nR)\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(T_a = (400 \times 10^3)
(2 \times 10^{-3})/((2)(8.314)) = 48^\circ\)</span>K. Here we have used the conversion <span class="math inline">\(1 \; liter = 10^{-3}m^3\)</span>. Similarily, <span class="math inline">\(T_b = 48^\circ\)</span>K and <span class="math inline">\(T_c = 24^\circ\)</span>K. The gas changes from state <span class="math inline">\(a \rightarrow b \rightarrow c 
\rightarrow a\)</span>. We will calculate <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(W_{by}\)</span> for each leg of the process. The results are:</p>

<p>We could repeat this cycle over and over again. What is happening per cycle? <span class="math inline">\(153\)</span> Joules of energy is added to the system, and the system does <span class="math inline">\(153\)</span> Joules of work. This is what an engine is supposed to do. A closed clockwise cycle will function as an engine. A closed counter-clockwise cycle will function as a refrigerator. For our engine cycle, a net <span class="math inline">\(Q_{in} = 553 + 598 = 1151\)</span> Joules is transfered into the gas, and a net <span class="math inline">\(Q_{out} = 998\)</span> Joules is transfered out of the gas. The difference <span class="math inline">\(W_{by} = Q_{in} - Q_{out}\)</span> is the work done by the gas.</p>
<p>What we would like to have happen is for most of the <span class="math inline">\(Q_{in}\)</span> to be converted to work, and little transfered out: <span class="math inline">\(Q_{out}\)</span>. We define the <span><strong>efficiency</strong></span>, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>, of a "heat-engine" to be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\epsilon \equiv {{W_{by}} \over {Q_{in}}}\]</span></p>
<p>This equation can also be written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\epsilon \equiv 1 - {{Q_{out}} \over {Q_{in}}}\]</span></p>
<p>since <span class="math inline">\(W_{by} = Q_{in} - Q_{out}\)</span>. For our example, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon = 153/1151 
\approx 0.13\)</span>, or a <span class="math inline">\(13 \%\)</span> efficiency. How can we make the efficiency large? What kind of cycle is the best? The answers to these important engineering questions require some thought and lead to some new ideas: the second law of thermodynamics and entropy. We will tackle these problems for the monatomic ideal gas, since we have a nice working model and it is a simple system. Then we will generalize our results.</p>
<p><strong>Entropy</strong></p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U\)</span> was summed up for a closed cycle the net change was zero. This is because <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is a state function of the system. It only depends on the state itself, and not how the state was formed. We represent the sum of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U\)</span> for a closed cycle as the integral <span class="math inline">\(\oint dU\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is a state function <span class="math inline">\(\oint dU = 0\)</span>. Examples of other state functions are <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> are not state functions. <span class="math inline">\(\oint dQ\)</span> is not zero as demonstrated by our last example. <span class="math inline">\(\oint dW = \oint p dV\)</span> is also not equal to zero in general, but is the area enclosed by the path of the cyclic process.</p>
<p>We would like to have a state function involving <span class="math inline">\(dQ\)</span>. Equivantly, we need to find an expression with <span class="math inline">\(dQ\)</span> such that when integrated over a complete cycle gives zero. Then we will have something absolute about <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, which will help us determine the maximum energy efficiency. We shall show that <span class="math inline">\(\oint dQ/T\)</span> is zero for any closed cycle for an ideal gas. First we will do a specific closed cycle example and calculate <span class="math inline">\(\int dQ/T\)</span> to show that <span class="math inline">\(\oint dQ/T = 0\)</span>. Then we will prove it for the general case of an ideal gas.</p>
<p>Consider a closed cycle process for an ideal monatomic gas that is bounded by two isothermal processes and two isometric processes. We will calculate the following table in lecture for the <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> legs:</p>

<p>where <span class="math inline">\(a \rightarrow b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c \rightarrow d\)</span> are isometric (constant <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>) processes, and <span class="math inline">\(b \rightarrow c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d \rightarrow a\)</span> are isothermal (constant <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>) processes.</p>
<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(\oint dQ/T = 0\)</span> for any value of <span class="math inline">\(V_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(V_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(T_H\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(T_C\)</span>. Is this true for any closed cycle? The answer is yes. We can prove it for a monatomic ideal gas:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[0 = \oint {{dV} \over V}\]</span></p>
<p>For any closed cycle, the above integral is just <span class="math inline">\(ln{V_i/V_i} = ln(1) = 0\)</span>. Using the equation for an ideal gas,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[0 = \oint {{p dV} \over {nRT}}\]</span></p>
<p>However, <span class="math inline">\(p dV\)</span> equals <span class="math inline">\(dQ - dU\)</span> from the first law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[0 = \oint {{dQ - dU} \over {nRT}}\]</span></p>
<p>For a monatomic gas, <span class="math inline">\(U = (3/2) nRT\)</span>. With this substitution we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[0 = \oint {{dQ} \over {nRT}} - {2 \over 3} \oint {{dU} \over U}\]</span></p>
<p>The second integral is zero, since <span class="math inline">\(\oint dU/U = ln(U_i/U_i) = ln(1) 
= 0\)</span>. Canceling out the <span class="math inline">\(nR\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[0 = \oint {{dQ} \over T}\]</span></p>
<p>Although this derivation was for the monatomic gas, the same line of reasoning will work for any ideal gas. The only difference in the derivation will be that <span class="math inline">\(U = f(T)\)</span>, that is <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is only a function of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. This is the key property of the system. If <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> only depends on <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(U(T)\)</span>, then then the integral of <span class="math inline">\(\int dU/T = \int (U&#39;(T)/T) dT\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(U&#39;(T) = dU/dT\)</span>. This integral will be zero over a closed cycle, since the integrand only depends on T.</p>
<p>The above result has profound consequences. It means that if <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q/T\)</span> is summed up from one state <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to another state <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, the integral <span class="math inline">\(\int_a^b dQ/T\)</span> is the same for any process that changes the system from <span class="math inline">\(a \rightarrow b\)</span>. The quantity <span class="math inline">\(\int_a^b dQ/T\)</span> only depends on the initial state <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and final state <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. This integral we call the <span><strong>entropy difference</strong></span> between the two states. Entropy is given the symbol <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S(b) - S(a) = \int_a^b {{dQ} \over T}\]</span></p>
<p>Entropy is a "state function" of a system, just like <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Before we try and identify what <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> depends on for a gas, we should remind ourselves on how it was discovered using a thermodynamics approach. The important step in making <span class="math inline">\(\oint dQ/T = 0\)</span>, was <span class="math inline">\(\oint dU/T =0\)</span>. This was made possible by our definition of temperature, which ended up being (for an ideal gas) proportional to the average kinetic energy per molecule and hence proportional to <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. We can turn the argument around, and say that <span><strong>it is possible to define temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\oint dQ/T = 0\)</span> for any cyclic process</strong></span>. This definition of temperature is independent of any thermometer, and this statement recognizes the existance of the entropy state function.</p>
<p><strong>Other Topics</strong></p>
<p>For all gases, the equation of state <span class="math inline">\(PV=nRT\)</span> is valid in the limit of an ideal gas (i.e. in the limit as the density goes to zero). The next most complicated gas after a monatomic gas is a diatomic gas, whose molecule has two atoms, e.g. <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(O_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(N_2\)</span>. The energy <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> moles of a monatomic gas was found to be <span class="math inline">\((3/2)nRT\)</span>. We can determine how the energy of a diatomic gas depends on temperature by measuring the heat capacity (per mole) for a constant volume process.</p>
<p>In a constant volume process, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U = Q = c_v \Delta T\)</span>. A graph of <span class="math inline">\(c_v\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> as a function of temperature will be shown in lecture. At low temperatures, <span class="math inline">\(c_v = (3/2) R\)</span> which is the same as the monatomic gas. However, as the temperature increases, <span class="math inline">\(c_v\)</span> jumps up to <span class="math inline">\((5/2) R\)</span> at around <span class="math inline">\(150^\circ\)</span>K. After a further increase in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(c_v\)</span> jumps up to <span class="math inline">\((7/2)R\)</span> at around <span class="math inline">\(3000^\circ\)</span>K. This behavour is strange for two reasons: 1) the sudden increase (or jump) of <span class="math inline">\(c_v\)</span> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, and 2) the first increase from <span class="math inline">\((3/2)R\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\((5/2)R\)</span>. The understanding of these features required "new" physics, quantum mechanics, which we cover in our modern physics course (Phy235).</p>
<p>Qualitatively, we understand the sudden increase in <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> for a diatomic molecule as rotational energy and vibrational energy. A diatomic molecule can translate (like a monatomic gas) in 3 different directions, rotate in 3 different directions and vibrate (two degrees of freedom). There is a theorum, <span><strong>the equipartition theorum</strong></span>, which states that for every degree of freedom that contributes quadratically to the energy, the average energy is <span class="math inline">\((RT)/2\)</span> per mole. If only translation is allowed, <span class="math inline">\(U = (3/2) RT\)</span>, since there are three directions, each of which contribute <span class="math inline">\((RT)/2\)</span>. Rotations should add <span class="math inline">\(3 \times (1/2)RT = (3/2)RT\)</span>, but they only seem to add <span class="math inline">\(RT\)</span> to the energy/mole. These descrepancies are resolved using quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>For our applications here, we just need to know <span class="math inline">\(c_v\)</span> for the conditions of our gas. Then,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta U = n c_v \Delta T\]</span></p>
<p>At room temperature, <span class="math inline">\(300^\circ\)</span>K, <span class="math inline">\(N_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(O_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> have <span class="math inline">\(c_v = (5/2) R\)</span>. The heat capacity at constant pressure is found in terms of <span class="math inline">\(c_v\)</span> as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[c_p = c_v + R\]</span></p>
<p>This can be shown as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \Delta U &amp; = &amp; Q - p \Delta V\\
  n c_v \Delta T &amp; = &amp; Q - p \Delta V \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Now for a constant pressure process, <span class="math inline">\(p \Delta V = \Delta (pV)\)</span>. So we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  n c_v \Delta T &amp; = &amp; Q - \Delta (pV)\\
                 &amp; = &amp; Q - \Delta (nRT)\\
  n (c_v + R) \Delta T &amp; = &amp; Q \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>which gives <span class="math inline">\(c_p = c_v + R\)</span>.<br />
The main difference between ideal gases and ideal monatomic gases (in our treatment) is that <span class="math inline">\(c_v\)</span> and hence <span class="math inline">\(c_p\)</span> depend on energy and might be different than the monatomic values of <span class="math inline">\((3/2)R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((5/2)R\)</span> respectively. This results in <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> being different also, since <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \equiv c_p/c_v\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using <span class="math inline">\(\oint dQ/T = 0\)</span>, we can determine an upper limit for efficiency of an engine. Consider a closed cycle (for an ideal gas) that acts like an engine. That is, the path is clockwise in the <span class="math inline">\(P-V\)</span> plane. Divide the path into small segments. For each segment, energy will either enter the system as heat (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q(in)\)</span> or leave the system as heat <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q(out)\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q\)</span> could also be zero. Label the segments for which energy enters as <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and those for which energy leaves as <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, where both <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> are summed. From <span class="math inline">\(\oint dQ/T = 0\)</span> we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum_i {{Q_i(in)} \over T_i}  - \sum_j {{Q_j(out)} \over T_j} = 0\]</span></p>
<p>where we have taken <span class="math inline">\(Q_j(out)\)</span> to be the absolute value of <span class="math inline">\(Q_j(out)\)</span>. The equation can be re-written</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum_i {{Q_i(in)} \over T_i}  = \sum_j {{Q_j(out)} \over T_j}\]</span></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T_{hottest}\)</span> be the largest value of the temperature during the cycle, and let <span class="math inline">\(T_{coldest}\)</span> be the lowest value of the temperature during the cycle. Then we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum_i {{Q_i(in)} \over T_i} \geq {1 \over T_{hottest}} \sum_i Q_i(in)\]</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum_i {{Q_i(in)} \over T_i} \geq {Q_{in} \over T_{hottest}}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(Q_{in}\)</span> is the sum of energy entering the gas via heat. Similarly,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum_i {{Q_j(out)} \over T_j} \leq {1 \over T_{coldest}} \sum_i Q_j(out)\]</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum_i {{Q_j(out)} \over T_j} \leq {Q_{out} \over T_{coldest}}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(Q_{out}\)</span> is the sum of energy leaving the gas via heat. Putting these equations together gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{Q_{in}} \over T_{hottest}} \leq   
  \sum {{Q_i(in)} \over T_i} =   
  \sum {{Q_j(out)} \over T_j}  \leq
  {{Q_{out}} \over T_{coldest}}\]</span></p>
<p>This inequality can be re-written</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{Q_{out}} \over {Q_{in}}} \geq {T_{coldest} \over T_{hottest}}\]</span></p>
<p>Since the efficiency <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon = 1 - Q_{out}/Q_{in}\)</span>, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\epsilon \leq 1 - {T_{coldest} \over T_{hottest}}\]</span></p>
<p>From these inequalities, one can see how to obtain the maximum efficiency. The equal sign will hold if all the energy transfered in (<span class="math inline">\(Q_{in}\)</span>) is done so at the hottest temperature, and all the energy transfered out (<span class="math inline">\(Q_{out}\)</span>) is done at the lowest temperature. The cycle that accomplishes this is a cycle that has two isothermal processes and two adiabatic processes. Such a cycle is called a <span><strong>Carnot Cycle</strong></span>. For a Carnot cycle, the efficiency <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{Carnot}\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\epsilon_{Carnot} = 1 - {{T_{cold}} \over {T_{hot}}}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(T_{hot}\)</span> is the temperature of the hot isothermal and <span class="math inline">\(T_{cold}\)</span> is the temperature of the cold isothermal. <span class="math inline">\(Q = 0\)</span> on the adiabatic legs of the cycle. The Carnot cycle is the most efficient engine operating between the hottest and coldest temperatures.</p>
<p>Previously we derived an expression for the difference in entropy between two states:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S(b) - S(a) = \int_a^b {{dQ} \over T}\]</span></p>
<p>Note: the integral gives the same value for any path taken from state <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. Although we derived this for an ideal gas, it holds for any substance. In evaluating the right side, usually <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> changes as energy is added or subtracted from the system, so one usually needs to integrate. Since <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q\)</span> is related to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T\)</span> via the heat capacity <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(dQ = C dT\)</span>, the entropy difference equation can be written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S(b) - S(a) = \int_a^b {{C(T) dT} \over T}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(C(T)\)</span> is the heat capacity and may depend on the temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. If the system changes from <span class="math inline">\(a \rightarrow b\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is a constant, then <span class="math inline">\(C(T) = C\)</span> factors out of the integral:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S(b) - S(a) = C \int_a^b {{dT} \over T} = C \; ln({T_b \over T_a})\]</span></p>
<p>For solids and liquids, <span class="math inline">\(C = m c_v\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(c_v\)</span> is the specific heat capacity. For gases <span class="math inline">\(C=n c_v\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(C=n c_p\)</span> depending if the process is isometric or isobaric.</p>
<p>Since entropy is heat/temperature, is there a simple connection between the direction of energy flow and entropy change? Yes there is. Consider two systems, one at temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_H\)</span> (hot) and the other at temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_C\)</span> (cold), where <span class="math inline">\(T_H &gt; T_C\)</span>. If a small amount of energy <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q\)</span> flows from the hot system to the colder one, the hot system loses entropy equal to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q / T_H\)</span>. The cold system gains entropy equal to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q / T_C\)</span>. The net entropy change of the two systems together is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta S_{net} = {{\Delta Q} \over T_C} - {{\Delta Q} \over T_H} &gt; 0\]</span></p>
<p>The sum is greater than zero since <span class="math inline">\(T_C &lt; T_H\)</span>. If on the other hand, energy were to flow from the cold system to the hot one, the net entropy change of the two systems together would be</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta S_{net} = {{\Delta Q} \over T_H} - {{\Delta Q} \over T_C} &lt; 0\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, it appears that when energy is transfered in the form of heat, the direction of the transfer is such that the net entropy of the two (or more) systems increases. Entropy somehow is related to the direction of energy transfer. The second law of thermodynamics states this more precisely:</p>
<p>: When an isolated system undergoes a change, the entropy of the system can only increase or remain the same.</p>
<p>We know that entropy is a state function and that it is somehow related to the direction of thermodynamic change, but specifically what is it a measure of? Since we have a working model of a monatomic gas, lets determine how the entropy depends on its macroscopic quantities. Suppose we have <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> moles of a monatomic gas. Let state <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> have a pressure <span class="math inline">\(P_a\)</span>, a volume <span class="math inline">\(V_a\)</span>, and a temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_a = (P_a V_a)/(nR)\)</span>. Let state <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> have a pressure <span class="math inline">\(P_b\)</span>, a volume <span class="math inline">\(V_b\)</span>, and a temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_b = (P_b V_b)/(nR)\)</span>. Let the process from <span class="math inline">\(a \rightarrow b\)</span> be in two parts: an isothermal followed by an isometric. For the isothermal, the temperature is constant at <span class="math inline">\(T_a\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta S_{isothermal} = \int {{dQ} \over T} = {Q \over T_a}\]</span></p>
<p>since <span class="math inline">\(T_a\)</span> factors out of the integral. <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is the net heat, and is equal to the work <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> done since <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U = 0\)</span> for an isothermal process. So we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \Delta S_{isothermal} &amp; = &amp; {W \over T_a}\\
                      &amp; = &amp; {1 \over T_a} \int P dV\\
                      &amp; = &amp; {1 \over T_a} \int {{nRT_a dV} \over V}\\
  \Delta S_{isothermal} &amp; = &amp; nR \; ln{V_b \over V_a}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>For the isometric leg, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q = (3/2) nR \Delta T\)</span>. The entropy change for this section is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \Delta S_{isometric} &amp; = &amp; \int {{3nR} \over 2} {{dT} \over T}\\
                       &amp; = &amp; {{3nR} \over 2} ln{T_b \over T_a}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Adding the two pieces together, we have for the entropy difference between the states <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> for an ideal monatomic gas:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S(b) - S(a) = nR(ln{V_b \over V_a} + {3 \over 2} ln{T_b \over T_a})\]</span></p>
<p>Since the temperature is proportional to the total internal energy <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((T_b / T_a) = (U_b / U_a)\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S(b) - S(a) = nR(ln{V_b \over V_a} + {3 \over 2} ln{U_b \over U_a})\]</span></p>
<p>in terms of the energy <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. We can examine this equation to see what the <span><strong>entropy</strong></span> depends on for a <span><strong>monatomic gas</strong></span>:<br />
: The entropy is proportional to the log of the energy <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> of the gas (if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> are constant). Entropy increases with energy, via the log.<br />
: The entropy is proportional to the log of the volume <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> of the gas (if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> are constant).<br />
The energy dependence gives us a relationship between entropy, energy and temperature. If we differentiate <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   {{\partial S} \over {\partial U}} &amp; = &amp; {{3nR} \over {2U}}\\
   {{\partial S} \over {\partial U}} &amp; = &amp; {1 \over T}    \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>since <span class="math inline">\(U = (3/2) nR T\)</span> for a monatomic gas. As we mention in the last paragraph (without proof), this relationship can be derived using statistical physics and can be used to define temperature.<br />
The volume dependence is interesting. If the volume of the gas gets larger, with no change in the energy, the entropy increases. Consider a container insulated from the "outside" with two chambers inside. Suppose the gas can travel from one chamber to the other only through a valve. Suppose the gas starts in one chamber with the valve closed, and the other chamber is a vacuum. If the valve is opened, the gas can move to the other chamber and after a while both chambers will be occupied by the gas. The energy of the gas did not change <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U = 0\)</span>. The temperature didn’t change. However, the entropy increased by an amount <span class="math inline">\(nR \; ln2\)</span>.</p>
<p>For a monatomic gas, entropy has something to do with the volume that the gas can move around in. The true meaning of entropy was discovered by Ludwig Boltzmann (1844-1906). He realized that entropy is related to the number of possible configurations of a system. He started a new field of physics called <span><strong>Statistical Physics</strong></span>, and revolutionized our treatment of thermodynamics. Statistical physics is a course of its own and usually taught in the senior year (Phy407).</p>
<p>Boltzmann defined a function <span class="math inline">\(\Omega (U)\)</span>, which equals the number of different ways that a system can arrange itself with total energy <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. Entropy <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is related to <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S = k \; ln(\Omega)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is Boltzmann’s constant. In statistical mechanics, the temperature of a system is defined by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{1 \over T} \equiv {{\partial S} \over {\partial U}}\]</span></p>
<p>This definition of temperature is universal. It works for any system. For an ideal gas, this definition for temperature results in temperature being proportional to <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. Serendipitously one obtains the same temperature using a constant-volume ideal-gas thermometer, for which temperature was initially defined proportional to pressure and later (using the kinetic theory) found to also be proportional to <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of Some Processes</strong></p>
<p>The simplist way to find <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(W_{by}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S\)</span> for a reversible process is to do the following. <span><em>First</em></span> determine <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U\)</span>, which equals <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U = (3/2)nR \Delta T\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U = (3/2) \Delta (PV)\)</span> for a monatomic gas. For a diatomic gas at room temperature just replace the <span class="math inline">\((3/2)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\((5/2)\)</span>. <span><em>Second</em></span> determine <span class="math inline">\(W_{by}\)</span> by finding the <span><strong>area under the curve in the P-V plane</strong></span>. <span class="math inline">\(W_{by}\)</span> is the same for any type of gas. <span><em>Third</em></span> find <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, which is just <span class="math inline">\(Q = \Delta U + W_{by}\)</span>. This is true for any type of gas. <span><em>Finally</em></span> determine <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S\)</span> by carrying out the integral <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S = \int (dQ)/T\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the temperature (in Kelvin) at which the incremental heat energy <span class="math inline">\(dQ\)</span> is transfered.</p>
<p><br />
For an isothermal process, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T=0\)</span> and hence <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U = 0\)</span>. This is true for both a monatomic and diatomic gas. If the process is reversible, then <span class="math inline">\(PV = nR T_0\)</span> during the process, where <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span> is the constant temperature. The work done by the gas is then <span class="math inline">\(W_{by} = \int P dV = nRT_0 \int (dV)/V\)</span>. The integral of <span class="math inline">\(\int dV/V = ln(V)\)</span>, and taking the limits from the initial volume <span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span> to the final volume <span class="math inline">\(V_f\)</span> gives <span class="math inline">\(W_{by} = nR T_0 ln(V_f/V_i)\)</span>. This is the work for both a monatomic and a diatomic gas. Since <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U = Q - W_{by}\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(Q = W_{by} = nR T_0 ln(V_f/V_i)\)</span>. To find the change in entropy for an isothermal process, we need to do the integral <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S = \int (dQ)/T = (1/T_0) \int dQ = Q/T_0\)</span>, since the temperature is constant. Using the expression for <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S = nR ln(V_f/V_i)\)</span>. We can summarize our results in the following chart:</p>

For an isobaric process, all the quantities <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(W_{by}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S\)</span> are non-zero. Let the pressure be <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>, and the initial and final volumes be <span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V_f\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U = (3/2)nR \Delta T = (3/2) \Delta (PV) = 
(3/2) P_0 (V_f - V_i)\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(W_{by} = P_0 (V_f - V_i)\)</span>. The "heat" energy transfer is <span class="math inline">\(Q = \Delta U + W_{by} = (5/2) P_0 (V_f - V_i)\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\((3/2) + 1 = (5/2)\)</span>. The change in entropy is <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S = \int (dQ)/T = \int (5/2) nR (dT)/T\)</span>. Evaluating the integral gives <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S = (5/2) nR \; ln(T_f/T_i)\)</span>, which equals <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S = (5/2) nR \; ln(V_f/V_i)\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\((T_f/T_i) = (V_f/V_i)\)</span> for an isobaric process. These results can be summarized in the following charts:</p>
