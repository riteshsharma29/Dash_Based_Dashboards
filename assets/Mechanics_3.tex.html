<span><strong>Rotational Dynamics</strong></span></p>
</div>
<p>So far we have only considered the motion of "point" objects. We have not allowed the objects to rotate, nor have we considered how forces might produce a "twisting force". In this last section, the last 2 1/2 weeks of the quarter, we will investigate the laws of physics pertaining to rotational motion. As we shall see, we can extend Newton’s laws for translational motion to include rotation, without introducing any new "laws of physics".</p>
<p>We will first study the condition for objects not to rotate, then analyze rotations about a fixed axis. Finally, we will extend our ideas to cases in which the axis of rotation can move, while keeping its direction constant.</p>
<p><strong>Remembering Statics</strong></p>
<p>In the first part of the course, we showed that there are two conditions that need to be satisfied in order for an object to stay at rest and not rotate: the sum of the forces must be zero and the net torque about any axis must also be zero:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   \sum_i \vec{F}_i &amp; =  &amp;0\\
   \sum_i \vec{\tau}_i &amp; = &amp; 0\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where the torque sum can be taken about any axis.</p>
<p>In class we will do many examples of many objects in static equilibrium. In evaluating the torque sum, a proper choice of axis can reduce the mathematical complexity.</p>
<p>You might wonder why the twisting force equals the product of force times distance from the axis. Consider a simple rigid object consisting of two masses connected by a massless rod on the earth. Suppose we consider balancing the object about a point on the massless rod. Let the object to the right have a mass <span class="math inline">\(m_1\)</span> and be at a distance <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> from the axis, and let the object to the left have a mass of <span class="math inline">\(m_2\)</span> and be at a distance of <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> from the axis. If the axis is the balance point then the rod will rotate with constant angular speed if slightly pushed. To see how the speed might change, we can use the work-energy theorum. Let <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> be the angle that the rod rotates. Then <span class="math inline">\(m_1\)</span> moves a distance <span class="math inline">\(x_1 \theta\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(m_2\)</span> moves a distance <span class="math inline">\(x_2 \theta\)</span>. The work done by gravity on the mass <span class="math inline">\(m_1\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(m_1 g x_1 \theta\)</span>, and the work done by gravity on the mass <span class="math inline">\(m_2\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(-m_2 g x_2 \theta\)</span>. Both objects sweep out the same angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. If the rod is to rotate with constant speed, then the Net Work done by gravity must be zero:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[m_1 g x_1 \theta - m_2 g x_2 \theta = 0\]</span></p>
<p>This equations yields <span class="math inline">\(m_1 g x_1 = m_2 g x_2\)</span>. Force times distance on one side equals force times distance on the other when the rod is balanced. We also verified this condition for balance in class. If <span class="math inline">\(m_1 x_1\)</span> were to be greater then <span class="math inline">\(m_2 x_2\)</span> then gravity would do more positive work on <span class="math inline">\(m_1\)</span> then negative work on <span class="math inline">\(m_2\)</span> because the distance traveled by <span class="math inline">\(m_1\)</span> would be greater than <span class="math inline">\(m_2/m_1\)</span> times <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>. There would be net work done by gravity and the rod’s "angular" speed would increase. We will derive this result more generally using the vector cross product later.</p>
<p><strong>Rotational Dynamics</strong></p>
<p>We will first discuss the dynamics of rotational motion about a fixed axis, then treat the case when the axis of rotation can translate.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Rotation of a Rigid Object about a fixed axis</strong></p>
<p>What is meant by a rigid object (or rigid body) is an object for which the separation between all pairs of points remains constant. When we talk about an object in this section, we mean rigid object. Let’s first discuss how we are going to describe rotation about an axis.</p>
<p>If the axis of rotation is fixed, then the objects orientation can be specified by an angle (with respect to a reference direction). Specifying the angle in units of degrees is an earthly standard. The assignment of <span class="math inline">\(360^\circ\)</span> for a complete rotation is probably because the earth turns <span class="math inline">\(365\)</span> times about its axis for every revolution around the sun. One degree is approximately the angle that the earth "sweeps out" around the sun in one day. A more universal measure of angle is the radian. The angle in radians is determined by drawing an arc of radius <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and measuring the distance of the arc, <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, that subtends the angle. The angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> in radians is defined as <span class="math inline">\(\theta \equiv s/r\)</span>. This definition is gives the same value for <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> for any radius value <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. This is really a universal definition which could be agreed upon by people living on any planet.</p>
<p>You might be wondering what kind of quantity angular displacement is. Is it a scalar or a vector, or something else? Angular displacement has a magnitude, but is there a direction associated with the displacement? There is an axis of rotation and a distinction can be made versus clockwise and counter-clockwise displacements. Thus, a direction and magnitude can be associated with an angular displacement: the direction is along the axis of rotation, with the right-hand rule defining positive displacements; the magnitude equals the amount of angular displacement. Although angular displacements have a magnitude and a direction, angular displacements do not add according to the laws of vector addition. Try it by rotating a book with the following example: <span class="math inline">\((\pi/2) \hat{i} + (\pi/2) \hat{j}\)</span> does not equal <span class="math inline">\((\pi/2) \hat{j} + (\pi/2) \hat{i}\)</span>. Actually, <span class="math inline">\((\pi/2) \hat{i} + (\pi/2) \hat{j}
= (-\pi/2) \hat{k} + (\pi/2) \hat{i}\)</span>. Rotations are not vectors, they form what mathematicians call a group.</p>
<p>An objects motion about a fixed axis is one of spinning. We can quantify how fast an object is spinning by how fast the angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is changing in time. We refer to the spinning speed as the <span><strong>angular velocity</strong></span>, and give it the symbol <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> (omega). The magnitude of the instaneous anglular velocity is the magnitude of the instaneous time rate of change of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[|\omega| \equiv |{{d \theta} \over {dt}}|\]</span></p>
<p>Is the angular velocity a scalar or a vector? As with displacement it has a magnitude and a direction. The direction is the axis of rotation, with clockwise and counter-clockwise determined by the right-hand rule. Curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the rotation, and your thumb points in the direction or <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\omega}\)</span>. As with angular displacement, angular velocities do not add like vectors. However it is still useful to associate a vector with angular velocity. The usefulness arises when one wants to relate the velocity of a particle rotating about an axis.</p>
<p>Consider an object rotating about an axis with angular velocity <span class="math inline">\(|\vec{\omega}|\)</span>. Let the origin of your coordinate system be located on the axis of rotation. That is, the vector <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\omega}\)</span> goes through the origin. Define the vector <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> as the position vector to the object that is rotating. The speed of the object is <span class="math inline">\(|\vec{\omega}|\)</span> times the perpendicular distance of the object to <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\omega}\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(|\vec{v}| = |\vec{\omega}| |\vec{r}| sin(\theta)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the angle between <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\omega}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span>. The direction of the particles velocity is perpendicular to both <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> and the vector <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\omega}\)</span>. Thus, the velocity <span class="math inline">\(\vec{v}\)</span> of a particle at a position <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> can be written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{v} = \vec{\omega} \times \vec{r}\]</span></p>
<p>This is a succinct way of expressing the velocity of an object that is rotating, and will be useful in deriving the equations of rotational motion.</p>
<p>Objects don’t always rotate with a constant angular velocity. As was done for the case of translational motion, acceleration is defined as the change in velocity. For the case of rotation, we can define the angular acceleration as the change in angular velocity.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[|\alpha| \equiv |{{d \omega} \over {dt}}|\]</span></p>
<p>In this class we will only consider situations in which the axis of rotation does not change direction. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> will be in the same direction as <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>.</p>
<p>For the special case of <span><strong>constant angular acceleration</strong></span> the relationship between the angular velocity <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> and angular displacement <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is simple. Since <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> have the same mathematical relationship to each other as <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> for one dimensional motion, the formulas for constant angular acceleration are the same as those for constant acceleration:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \alpha &amp; = &amp; \alpha_0\\
  \omega &amp; = &amp; \alpha_0 t + \omega_0\\
  \theta &amp; = &amp; {{\alpha_0} \over 2} t^2 + \omega_0 t + \theta_0\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\omega_0\)</span> is the initial angular velocity, and <span class="math inline">\(\theta_0\)</span> is the initial angular displacement. The angular acceleration is <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_0\)</span>, which is constant. From the middle equation, <span class="math inline">\(t = (\omega - \omega_0)/\alpha_0\)</span>. This expression for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> can be substituted into the last equation to give:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2 \alpha (\theta - \theta_0)\]</span></p>
<p>Remember, the above equations are only valid for the special case of <span><em>constant</em></span> angular acceleration.</p>
<p><img src="fig3nb.png" style="width:14cm" alt="image" /></p>
<p><strong>Energy of Rotation for a Rigid Object about a fixed axis</strong></p>
<p>When we analyzed translational motion, we started first with the relationship between acceleration, force and mass. Then we discussed the work-energy theorum and kinetic energy. For rotational motion, it is easier to first discuss energy considerations, then how torque changes angular velocity.</p>
<p>Let’s consider the energy of motion (rotational kinetic energy) of a rigid object rotating about a fixed axis. We first start with the simple case of a rigid object consisting of two objects of mass <span class="math inline">\(m_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_2\)</span> connected by a massless rod. Let the axis of rotation be on the axis, and mass <span class="math inline">\(m_1\)</span> be located a distance of <span class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span> from the axis and mass <span class="math inline">\(m_2\)</span> be located a distance of <span class="math inline">\(r_2\)</span>. If the rod is rotating about its axis with an angular velocity <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, the speed <span class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span> of each object is <span class="math inline">\(v_i = r_i \omega\)</span>. The energy of motion of the rigid object is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  K.E. &amp; = &amp; {m_1 \over 2} v_1^2 + {m_2 \over 2} v_2^2\\
       &amp; = &amp; {m_1 \over 2} (\omega r_1)^2 + {m_2 \over 2} (\omega r_2)^2\\
  K.E. &amp; = &amp; {{m_1 r_1^2 + m_2 r_2^2} \over 2} \omega^2  \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>A nice property of rotational motion about a fixed axis is that the angular velocity <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is the same for both objects. This allows a factorization of the kinematical quantity (<span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>) from the inertial quantity <span class="math inline">\(m_1 r_1^2 + m_2 r_2^2\)</span>. As we shall see, the combination of masses times distance squared always appears as an inertia to changes in rotational motion. It is a special combination, and deserves a special name, <span><strong>rotational inertial</strong></span>, and is given the symbol <span class="math inline">\(I_A\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I_A \equiv m_1 r_1^2 + m_2 r_2^2\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> denotes the axis about which the rigid object is rotating. The rotational inertial depends not only on the amount of mass that is rotating, but also on the location of the masses (i.e. the distance the masses are from the axis of rotation). When dealing with rotational inertial, remember to always specify the axis about which the inertial is determined.</p>
<p>The expression for rotational inertial can be generalized to any number of point particles that are "rigidly" connected. If <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> point objects are connected so that their relative distances do not change, the rotational inertial about the axis <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  I_A &amp; = &amp; m_1 r_1^2 + m_2 r_2^2 + m_3 r_3^2 + ...\\
      &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i=1}^N m_i r_i^2\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>This expression can also be extended to a solid object. To do this, we divide the solid object up into <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> small pieces. We can denote <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span> as the mass of piece <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(r_i\)</span> as the distance to the axis of rotation. Note: the distance <span class="math inline">\(r_i\)</span> is the shortest distance from <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span> to the axis (i.e. the perpendicular distance). The mass <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span> can be written as <span class="math inline">\(\rho \Delta V_i\)</span>. If we take the limit as <span class="math inline">\(N \rightarrow
\infty\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta V_i \rightarrow 0\)</span>, the sum becomes an integral:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I_A = \int \rho r^2 dV\]</span></p>
<p>In lecture we will calculate <span class="math inline">\(I_A\)</span> for a thin rod of length <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and mass <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> for axis of rotation <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> about an end of the rod and about the middle of the rod. We will also calculate <span class="math inline">\(I_A\)</span> for a uniform cylinder for rotations about the center.</p>
<p>The kinetic energy of rotation (rotational kinetic energy) for any rigid object rotating about the <span><em>fixed axis</em></span> <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[K.E. (of\: rotation) = {I_A \over 2} \omega_A^2\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(I_A\)</span> is the rotational inertia about the axis <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\omega_A\)</span> is the angular velocity about the axis <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamics of a rigid object about a fixed axis</strong></p>
<p>Many engineering applications involve rigid objects rotating about fixed axes. For this reason we discuss briefly this special situation. The simplest case is one particle of mass <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> attached by massless rod to an axis point <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Let the position vector from the axis to the particle be <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span>. The particle is confined to rotate a distance <span class="math inline">\(r \equiv |\vec{r}|\)</span> away from the point <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Suppose the particle is subject to the net force <span class="math inline">\(\vec{F}_{net}\)</span> at a particular time. What kind of motion will happen? Only the component of the force <span class="math inline">\(\vec{F}_{net}\)</span> perpendicular to <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> will cause any change in the particles speed. The component perpendicular to <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(|\vec{F}_{net}| sin(\theta)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the angle between <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{F}_{net}\)</span>. This component of the force will cause an acceleration equal to <span class="math inline">\(|\vec{F}_{net}| sin(\theta)/m\)</span> along the path of the rotating particle.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[|\vec{F}_{net}| sin(\theta) = m |\vec{a}|\]</span></p>
<p>If we multiply both sides by r, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[r |\vec{F}_{net}| sin(\theta) = m r |\vec{a}|\]</span></p>
<p>Since the particle is always the same distance from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, the particle’s acceleration is along the circle confining the particle. Thus, the acceleration can be specified by the angular acceleration about the axis point <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|\vec{a}| = |\vec{\alpha}| r\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  r |\vec{F}_{net}| sin(\theta) &amp; = &amp; m r^2 {{|\vec{a}|} \over r}\\
                         &amp; = &amp; m r^2 |\vec{\alpha}|     \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The left side of the equation is recognized as the torque about the axis <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\alpha}\)</span> will point along the same direction as <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r} \times \vec{F}_{net}\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \vec{r} \times \vec{F}_{net} &amp; = &amp; m r^2 \vec{\alpha}_A\\
         \tau_{net} &amp; = &amp; I_A \alpha_A\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where the subscript <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> refers to the axis <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\alpha}\)</span> are measured about the axis <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. From this derivation, one can see that the end result is just Newton’s second law for translational motion applied to the motion in a circle that a particle must move if connected by a rigid (massless) rod to an axis point. As we will show, this expression also applies in general to a solid rigid object rotating about a fixed axis.</p>
<p>Consider a rigid object confined to rotate about a fixed axis <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Suppose a force <span class="math inline">\(\vec{F}\)</span> is applied at a position <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> from the axis. Let <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \theta\)</span> be the (small) angle the object turns while the force is applied. The work done on the system <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> by the force is the component of the force perpendicular to <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> times <span class="math inline">\(r \Delta \theta\)</span>, which is the distance the force acts:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W = F_{\perp} (\Delta \theta r)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(F_{\perp}\)</span> is the component of <span class="math inline">\(\vec{F}\)</span> perpendicular to <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span>. This can also be written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W = |\vec{r} \times \vec{F}| \Delta \theta\]</span></p>
<p>The torque times the angular displacement is the work that the torque does. If this is the only torque that does work on the system, then it is equal to a change in kinetic energy (work-energy theorum):</p>
<p>Torque times angular displacement equals change in K.E.</p>
<p>Letting <span class="math inline">\(\Delta (K.E.)\)</span> denote the change in kinetic energy, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \tau_A \Delta \theta &amp; = &amp; \Delta (K.E.)\\
                      &amp; = &amp; \Delta ({I_A \over 2} \omega_A^2)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>If the torque occurs over a small time interval <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span>, the equation becomes</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\tau_A {{\Delta \theta} \over {\Delta t}} = 
                            {{\Delta ({I_A \over 2} \omega_A^2)} \over {\Delta t}}\]</span></p>
<p>Taking the limit as <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> goes to zero results in derivatives with respect to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\tau_A {{d \theta} \over {dt}} = {{I_A} \over 2} {{d \omega^2} \over {dt}}\]</span></p>
<p>or</p>

<p>canceling the <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> on both sides:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\tau_A = I_A \alpha_A\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, for a rigid object confined to rotate about a fixed axis, <span><strong>the net torque about the axis equals the rotational inertial times the angular acceleration about the axis</strong></span>. To generalize to situations where the axis of rotation is not fixed and where the rotational inertial can change, it is useful to introduce a new quantity: angular momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Rotational Dynamics if the axis of rotation is moving</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kinetic Energy for objects rotating and translating</strong></p>
<p>Before we discuss how torques affect rotational motion, it is instuctive to consider the energy of motion for objects that are rotating and translating (moving). The complicated situation of rotation while the object is moving is made simple by expressing ’translation of’ and ’rotation about’ the center-of-mass of the object. The expression for the total energy of motion is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Total \: K.E. = {{M_{total}} \over 2} V_{c.m.}^2 +
                    {{I_{c.m.}} \over 2} \omega_{c.m.}^2\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s derive this equation to understand why the center-of-mass plays such an important role. Consider a system of particles, or a rigid object, that is subject to certain forces. We will analyze the system of particles in an inertial reference (lab frame) in which the center of mass (c.m.) of the system is moving. The velocity of the c.m. for <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> particles is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{V}_{c.m.} = {{\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \vec{v}_i} \over {M_{tot}}}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(M_{tot} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i\)</span> is the total mass of the system. Let <span class="math inline">\(\vec{u}_i\)</span> be the velocity of object <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> with respect to the center-of-mass reference frame. That is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{v}_i = \vec{V}_{c.m.} + \vec{u}_i\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\vec{v}_i\)</span> is the velocity of particle <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> as measured in the inertial reference frame (lab frame), and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{V}_{c.m.}\)</span> is the velocity of the c.m. Note that in the c.m. frame:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \vec{u}_i = 0\]</span></p>
<p>The center of mass frame is also called the center of momentum frame, since the total momentum of the system is zero in the c.m. frame.</p>
<p>The total kinetic energy is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  Total \: K.E. &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i=1}^N {m_i \over 2} v_i^2\\
                &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i=1}^N {m_i \over 2} (\vec{v}_i \cdot \vec{v}_i)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting the expression for <span class="math inline">\(\vec{v}_i\)</span> above gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  Total \: K.E. &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i=1}^N {m_i \over 2} (\vec{V}_{c.m.} + \vec{u}_i) \cdot 
                                   (\vec{V}_{c.m.} + \vec{u}_i)\\
               &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i=1}^N {m_i \over 2} (V_{c.m.}^2  
                              + 2 \vec{V}_{c.m.} \cdot \vec{u}_i + u_i^2)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>In the center of mass frame, the middle term sums to zero:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \vec{V}_{c.m.} \cdot \vec{u}_i &amp; = &amp; \vec{V}_{c.m.}
                                   \cdot    \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \vec{u}_i\\
                                 &amp; = &amp; 0    \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>since in the c.m. frame <span class="math inline">\(\sum m_i \vec{u}_i = 0\)</span>. Thus, the total K.E. separates into two parts:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  Total \: K.E. &amp;  = &amp;  \sum_{i=1}^N {m_i \over 2} (V_{c.m.}^2  + u_i^2)\\
                &amp; = &amp;  {{M_{total}} \over 2} V_{c.m.}^2 + {1 \over 2} 
                                  \sum_{i=1}^N m_i u_i^2\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The second term in the expression is the kinetic energy as measured in the c.m. frame. For the case of a rigid object, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{u}_i = \vec{\omega} \times \vec{r}_i\)</span>. The magnitude of <span class="math inline">\(\vec{u}_i\)</span> squared is <span class="math inline">\((\vec{\omega} \times \vec{r}_i)^2\)</span>, which after summing over all particles (and some algebra) gives <span class="math inline">\((\sum m_i r_i^2) \omega_{c.m.}^2\)</span>. For a rigid object, the above expression becomes</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Total \: K.E. = {{M_{total}} \over 2} V_{c.m.}^2 + {{I_{c.m.}} \over 2} \omega_{c.m.}^2\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, <span><strong>the total energy of motion equals the translational kinetic energy of the center of mass plus the rotational kinetic energy about the center of mass</strong></span>. The key for the separation of the translational energy of the system from the rotational energy about an axis was to find a reference frame in which <span class="math inline">\(\sum m_i u_i = 0\)</span>. This is the definition of the center-of-mass (or momentum) frame. A complicated expression is made simple when viewed from the right perspective.</p>
<p>We would like to generalize the result for rigid object rotating about a fixed axis to the case of an axis of rotation that is not fixed as well as the case when <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> can change. We will consider a system made up of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> particles. If the system is a rigid body, then the distances between the particles is fixed and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> approaches infinity as the particle size goes to zero. Let <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}_i\)</span> be the position vector, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{v}_i\)</span> be the velocity, and <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span> be the mass of particle <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{v}_i\)</span> both depend on time. The key to a succinct formalism is the following vector identity which applied to every particle:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{d (\vec{r} \times \vec{p})} \over {dt}} = ({{d \vec{r}} \over {dt}} \times \vec{p})
                            + (\vec{r} \times {{d \vec{p}} \over {dt}})\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\vec{p}\)</span> is the momentum of the particle. For a single particle, the momentum is <span class="math inline">\(\vec{p} = m \vec{v}\)</span>. So, the first term on the right hand side is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  {{d \vec{r}} \over {dt}} \times \vec{p} &amp; = &amp; \vec{v} \times (m \vec{v})\\
                                          &amp; = &amp; m (\vec{v} \times \vec{v})\\
                                          &amp; = &amp; 0\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{d (\vec{r}_i \times \vec{p}_i)} \over {dt}} = \vec{r}_i \times {{d \vec{p}_i} \over {dt}}\]</span></p>
<p>for each particle <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. This is a wonderful vector equation. Now we can put in the physics: <span class="math inline">\(\vec{F}_{i-net} = (d \vec{p}_i)/(dt)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\vec{F}_{i-net}\)</span> is the net force on particle <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Substituting gives:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{d (\vec{r}_i \times \vec{p}_i)} \over {dt}} = \vec{r}_i \times \vec{F}_{i-net}\]</span></p>
<p>The expression on the right side is recognized as the net torque on particle <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> about the origin, <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{i-net}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{d (\vec{r}_i \times \vec{p}_i)} \over {dt}} = \tau_{i-net}\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, the torque on a particle changes the quantity <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r} \times \vec{p}\)</span>. What is <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r} \times \vec{p}\)</span>? It’s magnitude is <span class="math inline">\(|\vec{r}| |\vec{p}| sin{\theta}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the angle between <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{p}\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(|\vec{p}| sin(\theta)\)</span> is the component of momentum perpendicular to <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span>. It is in essence the "rotational" momentum of the particle about the origin. The name given to <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r} \times \vec{p}\)</span> is the <span><strong>angular momentum</strong></span> of the particle about the origin. Note that <span><em>the particle does not have to be rotating to have angular momentum</em></span>. A particle moving in a straight line can have an angular momentum about a point (or origin).<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Angular Momentum</strong></p>
<p>The symbol for angular momentum is usually <span class="math inline">\(\vec{L}\)</span>. For particle "i", <span class="math inline">\(\vec{L}_i \equiv \vec{r}_i \times \vec{p}_i\)</span>. Note that the angular momentum of a particle will depend on the frame of reference, since the position vector <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> is measured from the origin of a particular reference frame. For a single particle, the above equation says that the time rate of change of a particles angular momentum equals the net torque on the particle.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{d \vec{L}_i} \over {dt}} = \tau_{i-net}\]</span></p>
<p>where the angular momentum and the torque are evaluated about the same axis. Note, that if the net torque on a particle equals zero, then the angular momentum of the particle about the axis is a constant of the motion. Forces that do not produce a torque are forces that lie along the direction <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For a collection of particles, we can define the total angular momentum of the system as the vector sum of the angular momentum of the particles:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{L}_{tot} \equiv \sum_{i=1}^N \vec{r}_i \times \vec{p}_i\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{p}\)</span> are true vectors, the angular momentum <span class="math inline">\(\vec{L}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{L}_i\)</span> will also have the properties of a vector. Note that <span class="math inline">\(\vec{L}_{tot}\)</span> will depend on the choice of origin.</p>
<p>Rotational dynamics is most easily handled by considering the time rate of change of the total angular momentum:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  {{d \vec{L}_{tot}} \over {dt}} &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i=1}^N {{d (\vec{r}_i \times \vec{p}_i)} \over {dt}}\\
                        &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i=1}^N {{d \vec{r}_i} \over {dt}} \times \vec{p}_i +
                                             \vec{r}_i \times {{d \vec{p}_i} \over {dt}}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The first term on the right side equals zero as before:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   {{d \vec{r}_i} \over {dt}} \times \vec{p}_i &amp; = &amp; \vec{v}_i \times \vec{p}_i\\
                               &amp; = &amp; \vec{v}_i \times m_i \vec{v}_i\\
                               &amp; = &amp; 0\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>since <span class="math inline">\(\vec{v}_i \times \vec{v}_i\)</span> equals zero. Thus, we have the same result for a system of particles as we did with one particle:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  {{d \vec{L}_{tot}} \over {dt}} &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i=1}^N \vec{r}_i \times {{d \vec{p}_i} \over {dt}}\\
                                 &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i=1}^N \vec{r}_i \times \vec{F}_{i-net}\\
                                 &amp; = &amp; \vec{\tau}_{net}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The time rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system of particles equals the net torque on the system. Note that this equation is valid for any axis point about which the torque and angular momentum are calculated (or measured).</p>
<p>For a system of particles, the above equation can be somewhat simplified. One can separate the force on each particle into a part that comes from other particles <span><em>in the system</em></span> or internal forces, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{F}_{i-int}\)</span>, and another part originating from sources <span><em>outside the system</em></span> or external forces, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{F}_{i-ext}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{F}_{i-net} = \vec{F}_{i-int} + \vec{F}_{i-ext}\]</span></p>
<p>The internal forces are forces between the particles in the system. Newton’s third law states that <span class="math inline">\(\vec{F}_{ij} = - \vec{F}_{ji}\)</span>. If these action-reaction forces act along the line joining particle <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, then the sum of the torques due to the internal forces will add to zero. Thus, the net torque on the system, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\tau}_{net}\)</span>, will equal the sum of the torques due to external forces, or net external torque, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\tau}_{net-ext}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{d \vec{L}_{tot}} \over {dt}} = \vec{\tau}_{net-ext}\]</span></p>
<p>This equation has an important consequence for a system of particles. <span><strong>If the net torque on a system is zero, then the total angular momentum is conserved!</strong></span> We can add another conserved quantity to our list: total momentum of a system, total angular momentum of a system, mechanical energy for conservative forces. The symmetry responsible for the conservation of angular momentum is rotational symmetry. Angular momentum and its conservation play a very important role in our understanding of atomic, nuclear and particle physics.</p>
<p>The above equation is quite general. In this class we will consider two special cases: 1) rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis, and 2) the case where the angular momentum vector does not change direction (although the axis of rotation can translate). These cases are important in engineering applications.</p>
<p>The expression for the angular momentum of a rigid object rotating about a fixed axis takes on a simple form. Consider a flat rigid object that is confined to rotate about an axis perpendicular to its surface. Divide the object up into N small pieces. Let the mass of piece <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> be <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span>, and let the mass be located a distance <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}_i\)</span> from the axis. Let the angular velocity about the axis be <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>. The speed of each piece is <span class="math inline">\(\omega |\vec{r}_i|\)</span>, and the direction of the velocity is perpendicular to <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}_i\)</span>. The angular momentum will lie along the direction of <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\omega}\)</span> with magnitude:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  |\vec{L}| &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i=1}^N r_i m_i v_i\\
            &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i=1}^N r_i m_i \omega r_i\\
            &amp; = &amp; (\sum_{i=1}^N m_i r_i^2) \omega\\ 
  |\vec{L}| &amp; = &amp; I \omega\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where the direction of <span class="math inline">\(\vec{l}\)</span> is in the same direction as <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\omega}\)</span>, and all quantities are calculated about the same axis, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Written more precisely:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{L}_A = I_A \vec{\omega}_A\]</span></p>
<p>The relationship between torque and angular momentum is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \vec{\tau}_{A-net} &amp; = &amp; {{d \vec{L}_A} \over {dt}}\\
               &amp; = &amp; I_A {{d \vec{\omega}_A} \over {dt}}\\
  \vec{\tau}_{A-net} &amp; = &amp; I_A \vec{\alpha}_A\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\tau}_{A-net}\)</span> is the net torque about the axis <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. You might remember that this is the same result we obtained before using energy considerations: the net work done by the torque equals the change in the rotational energy of the object.</p>
<p>The translational motion and rotational motion of a rigid object (or a system of particles) separate if the center-of-mass is used as a reference point. The position of the center of mass for a system of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> particles, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{R}_{cm}\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{R}_{cm} \equiv {{\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \vec{r}_i} \over {\sum_{i=1}^N m_i}}\]</span></p>
<p>Letting <span class="math inline">\(M_{tot} \equiv \sum_{i=1}^N m_i\)</span>, we can also write the center of mass position as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{R}_{cm} \equiv {{\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \vec{r}_i} \over {M_{tot}}}\]</span></p>
<p>The velocity of the center of mass, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{V}_{cm}\)</span> is found by differentiating the expression for <span class="math inline">\(\vec{R}_{cm}\)</span> with respect to time:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{V}_{cm} \equiv {{\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \vec{v}_i} \over {M_{tot}}}\]</span></p>
<p>The center of mass is a special point for a system of particles, or a rigid object. For a reference frame that <span><em>moves such that the center of mass is at the origin</em></span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \vec{r}_i = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \vec{v}_i = 0\)</span>. This reference frame is called the "center-of-mass" frame, or "center-of-momentum" frame. By analyzing the dynamics from this frame, the translational motion of the center- of-mass of a system (or rigid object) separates from the rotational motion about the center-of-mass. This can be seen as follows:</p>
<p>Consider a frame of reference at rest with respect to the earth. We will refer to this frame of reference as the lab frame. Let <span class="math inline">\(\vec{R}_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{V}_i\)</span> be the position and the velocity of particle <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> as measured by the lab frame. Let <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{v}_i\)</span> be the position and velocity of particle <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> as measured in the center of mass frame described above. If <span class="math inline">\(\vec{R}_{cm}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{V}_{cm}\)</span> are the position and velocity of the center of mass of the system (or rigid object), we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{R}_i = \vec{R}_{cm} + \vec{r}_i\]</span></p>
<p>for the position of particle <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{V}_i = \vec{V}_{cm} + \vec{v}_i\]</span></p>
<p>for the velocity of particle <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. The angular momentum of the system of particles in the lab reference frame is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{L}_{lab} = \sum_{i=1}^N \vec{R}_i \times m_i\vec{V}_i\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span> is the mass of particle <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and we have written the momentum as mass times velocity, <span class="math inline">\(m_i \vec{V}_i\)</span>. If we express these variables in terms of the position and velocity as measured in the center of mass frame, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{L}_{lab} = \sum_{i=1}^N (\vec{R}_{cm} + \vec{r}_i)
                    \times m_i(\vec{V}_{cm} + \vec{v}_i)\]</span></p>
<p>After expanding the product on the right side of the equation, we have four terms:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \vec{L}_{lab} &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i=1}^N (\vec{R}_{cm} \times m_i\vec{V}_{cm})\\
             &amp;  &amp; + \sum_{i=1}^N (\vec{R}_{cm} \times m_i\vec{v}_{i})\\
             &amp;  &amp; + \sum_{i=1}^N (\vec{r}_{i} \times m_i\vec{V}_{cm})\\
             &amp;  &amp; + \sum_{i=1}^N (\vec{r}_{i} \times m_i\vec{v}_{i})\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>However, the middle two terms are zero due to the properties of the center of mass reference frame. This can be seen as follows. The second term is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \sum_{i=1}^N (\vec{R}_{cm} \times m_i\vec{v}_{i}) &amp; = &amp; \vec{R}_{cm}
                                     \times \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \vec{v}_i\\
                      &amp; = &amp; 0\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>since <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \vec{v}_i\)</span> is zero in the center of mass frame. The third term is also zero,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
 \sum_{i=1}^N (\vec{r}_{i} \times m_i \vec{V}_{cm}) &amp; = &amp; (\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \vec{r}_i)
                                   \times \vec{V}_{cm}\\
                    &amp; = &amp; 0\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>since <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \vec{r}_i\)</span> is zero in the center of mass frame. So the angular momentum measured in the lab frame separates into two pieces:</p>

<p>Thus, <span><strong>eventhough the center of mass is moving, the net torque about the center of mass equals the time rate of change of the angular momentum about the center of mass</strong></span>. This is a very nice result: analyzing the motion about the center of mass greatly simplifies our analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of Rotational Dynamics</strong></p>
<p>This concludes the discussion on rotational motion for our first year physics course. The relationships that we developed on rotational dynamics were derived from Newton’s Laws of motion. We did not need to introduce any "new physics" the past 3 weeks. We applied the laws for translation motion to rotations. We realized that the rotational part of the motion is the part perpendicular to the position vector, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\vec{A}\)</span> is a translational quantity, then <span class="math inline">\(|\vec{r}| |\vec{A}| sin\theta\)</span> is the corresponding rotational quantity. Here <span class="math inline">\(\vec{A}\)</span> can be the force, momentum, velocity or acceleration vectors, and <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the angle between <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{A}\)</span>. The vector cross product is the mathematical operation that facilates our analysis. Thus starting with Newton’s second law for particle <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in a system of particles:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{F}_{i-net} = {{d \vec{p}_i} \over {dt}}\]</span></p>
<p>we can take the vector product of both sides with <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}_i\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\vec{r}_i \times \vec{F}_{i-net} &amp; = &amp; \vec{r}_i \times {{d \vec{p}_i} \over {dt}}\\
                   &amp; = &amp; {{d (\vec{r}_i \times \vec{p}_i) } \over {dt}}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where the second equation equals the first since <span class="math inline">\(\vec{v}_i \times 
m_i \vec{v}_i = 0\)</span>. Thus, we are motivated to define a "twisting force" vector (torque) as <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r} \times \vec{F}\)</span>, and a "rotational momentum" vector (angular momentum) as <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r} \times
\vec{p}\)</span>. With these definitions, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{\tau}_{i-net} = {{d \vec{L}_i } \over {dt}}\]</span></p>
<p>Summing over the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> particles in a system gives:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
 \sum_{i=1}^N \vec{\tau}_{i-net} &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i=1}^N {{d \vec{L}_i } \over {dt}}\\
      \vec{\tau}_{net} = {{d \vec{L}_{net}} \over {dt}}  \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>From this equation, we showed how translation and rotation can be separated from each other via the center-of-mass reference frame.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of Vector Operations</strong></p>
<p>We have covered all the vector operations that we will need for our first year physics series. Let’s summarize them:</p>
<p>: When two vectors are added, the result is another vector. Vector addition is commutative, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{A} + \vec{B} = \vec{B} + \vec{A}\)</span>. The "tail-to-tip" method satisfies the commutative property. In terms of components, <span class="math inline">\((\vec{A} + \vec{B})_x = A_x + B_x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((\vec{A} + \vec{B})_y = A_y + B_y\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\((\vec{A} + \vec{B})_z = A_z + B_z\)</span>. If physical quantites are vectors, addition of vectors is used to find the NET sum of the quantites (e.g. the net force).</p>
<p>: Multiplication of a vector by a scalar <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> changes the magnitude of the vector by the factor <span class="math inline">\(|c|\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(c&gt;0\)</span>, then the direction remains the same, but if <span class="math inline">\(c&lt;0\)</span> the direction is reversed. Multiplication by a scalar enables one to define unit vectors, whose linear combinations span the vector space.</p>
<p>: The scalar product of one vector with another vector yields a scalar. Since two vectors are involved, the scalar product must depend on the magnitudes of each vector and the relative direction of one to the other. If <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the angle between the vectors, the scalar product could depend on either <span class="math inline">\(sin(\theta)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(cos(\theta)\)</span>. Since the scalar product should be commutative, <span class="math inline">\(cos(\theta)\)</span> is the only choice since <span class="math inline">\(cos(-\theta)=cos(\theta)\)</span>. Thus in order to be commutative, the scalar product must be <span class="math inline">\(\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B}
=|\vec{A}| |\vec{B}| cos(\theta)\)</span>. In terms of components, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = A_x B_x + A_y B_y + A_z B_z\)</span>. In physics, the scalar product represents the component of one vector in the direction of another (times its magnitude). It allowed us to express the work done by a force in acting in a certain direction easily (<span class="math inline">\(\vec{F} \cdot \Delta \vec{r})\)</span>.</p>
<p>: The vector product of one vector with another yields a vector. Since two vectors are involved here also, the vector product must depend on the magnitudes of each vector and the relative direction of one to the other. Since the result must be a vector, there is only one special direction: the direction perpendicular to <span class="math inline">\(\vec{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{B}\)</span>. Should <span class="math inline">\(sin(\theta)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(cos(\theta)\)</span> be used? Theta equal to zero helps us determine the proper choice. If <span class="math inline">\(\vec{A}\)</span> is parallel to <span class="math inline">\(\vec{B}\)</span> then there is no special direction, so the vector product must be zero in this case. The trig function that is zero for <span class="math inline">\(\theta = 0\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(sin(\theta)\)</span>. Thus, the only way to define a vector product of two vectors is to use the sin function as described above.</p>
<p>These vector operations will be very important in describing the electro- magnetic interaction. This is because the magnetic part of the interaction depends on the velocity of the particles. With so many vectors involved, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{F}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{v}\)</span>, the scalar and vector products are important. It will also be necessary to consider derivatives of vectors, i.e. vector calculus. Here we will consider rotational motion, and we will see the usefulness of the vector product.</p>
